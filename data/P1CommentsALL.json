{"body":"When I first started having sex with my husband, I hated it.  Did it mostly to please him.  He's also the first (and only) guy I've been with.  I could masturbate with no problems, orgasm during oral...all that jazz, but I hated the actual penetration part.  Also hated giving oral, so that made my husband hate life.  We averaged 1-2 times a week for the first three years of our sexual relationship.  We got together when I was 17, broke hymen (not actual sex) at 17, and had less-than-pleasurable sex til I was 21.  Then, I got pregnant with our first son, and he didn't get any action for about seven months of the pregnancy...my already-low sex drive dropped to non-existent.  \n\nAfter our son was born, I felt like a virgin again, and didn't want sex, at all.  That lasted about a year and seven months...then something changed.  I got my IUD removed, and I suddenly couldn't get enough of it...we were going twice a night, at least four times a week, with the occasional \"nooner.\"  Fast-forward to May 2010...pregnant again.  Had sex about six months in, then it was all him.  After second son born, had sex at 3wks post-partum, took a break til I got the okay from my doctor, and since then it's almost every night, sometimes twice a day (averages ten times a week).  I've gotten more adventurous (really wanna try being tied up, currently working on anal), and our sex life has never been better.\n\nHonestly, I attribute the whole lack of a sex drive to birth control.  I started it before we started having sex (at 17), and years later he told me that it changed me...the hormones messed with my head too much.  As soon as I stopped taking it (both pill form and IUD), sex became much more enjoyable, and felt less like a chore.\n\nI guess my story is more of a reverse of the original scenario, but it can't hurt to see a different side...see how a sex drive got to where it's at now.\n\nEdit: changed date at beginning.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c3lfhro","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1327725794","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3p","link_id":"t3_p02kd","parent_id":"t3_p02kd","score":"145","retrieved_on":"1428253422","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c3lfhro","subreddit":"sex","ups":"145","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Okay, let me break it down for you.\n\nThe film begins with the last race of the Piston Cup championship, which ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran Strip \"The King\" Weathers, infamous runner-up Chick Hicks, and rookie Lightning McQueen. The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the fictional Los Angeles International Speedway in California. Lightning is desperate to win the race, since it would allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a rust treatment for old cars, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, Lightning pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, the exhausted Mack drifts off and is startled by a gang of reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the truck into the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic, and speeds off the highway to find Mack, ending up in the run-down town of Radiator Springs and inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road.\n\n\nAfter being arrested and impounded overnight, guarded by a rusty but friendly tow truck named Mater, McQueen is ordered by the town's judge and doctor, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately. The local lawyer, Sally Carrera, insists that McQueen be given community service to repave the road, to which Doc begrudingly agrees. McQueen tries to repave it in a single day, but it turns out to be shoddy and McQueen is ordered to repave the road again, which takes several days to complete. During this time, he becomes friends with several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover along U.S. Route 66, but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing the town, it literally vanished from the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is really the \"Fabulous Hudson Hornet\", a three-time Piston Cup winner who was forced out of racing after an accident in 1954 and quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes the road, which has invigorated the cars to improve their town, and spends an extra day in town with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town, led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race, while Sally chastises Doc after discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered himself instead.\n\n\nAt the speedway, McQueen's mind is not fully set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc Hudson, decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. Hicks, refusing to lose, sends Weathers into a dangerous accident. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory and give praise to McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with his current sponsors as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_ck7zrsh","author":"davidkones","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1409752723","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_2fcpf0","parent_id":"t1_ck7yen5","score":"1766","retrieved_on":"1427219123","controversiality":"0","gilded":"1","id":"ck7zrsh","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"1766","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Judge this story as you will. \n\n\nA couple of years a ago I was at a party at university. I was holding my arm around this incredibly drunk girl. This girl was so beautiful, so cute. Not to mention incredibly smart and intelligent. But she was wasted. She couldn't even complete a sentence. I was drunk too, but I knew exactly what I was doing - I was taking this girl home. There was no way I would let her go anywhere  without me.  I asked her if she wanted to go home with me, but couldn't really get an answer.  So eventually I decide to pull her out of her chair. I'm not sure if she agreed or not, but at least she didn't resist as I got her on her feet. I thought that was a good enough sign. So I hold my arms around her as we left the party. As we were leaving, I remember this guy smiling and laughing at me, as he watched me carrying out this incapacitated cute girl. Nodding at me, appearing to be envious he hadn't come up with that idea himself. I remember thinking \"fuck that guy, *I* am taking her home\". I will never forget the face that clearly said i was the cool guy for taking her. Fuck people like that.\n\nSo we get out and I get a taxi home for us. I basically have to drag her out of the taxi, into the appartment and throw her on the bed. I think she was too drunk to realize what was even going on. I mean, she seriously wasn't there anymore. Anyway, she passes out on the bed. I go get her a glass of water for the morning and some painkillers and sleeps next to her.\n\nThe next day she wakes up and I tell her (most of) the story. She's embarrassed , but tells me she's   really happy she's living together with such a nice boyfriend. \n\nTl;dr: My SO sometimes gets too wasted at uni parties. \n\nEdit: clarifications.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cmdz0im","author":"McTuggets","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1417042120","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_2ni1qf","parent_id":"t1_cmdtooj","score":"702","retrieved_on":"1425825186","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cmdz0im","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"702","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"I prefer this variant:\n\nSo there once was this wasp that lived in a jungle. This was not your ordinary wasp though - he was smart, philosophical even. One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do. So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him.\n\nHe goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it. \nOf course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp\u2019s departure, but they all know it\u2019s what must be done. Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother. So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment. Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there\u2019s an extremely long line. He decides it\u2019s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he\u2019s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it\u2019s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but waddya know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch. He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line. =P","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cdp74dt","author":"mattlaten","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1385678707","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_1rnjev","parent_id":"t1_cdp4gde","score":"212","retrieved_on":"1428470707","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cdp74dt","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"212","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

Without spoilers, the only way to increase the grip would be to increase the weight, or to change the material the tires are made of.

All that extra weight has inertia, which you have to overcome to turn, so increasing the weight doesn't help at all. The way the spoiler works is like an airplane wing, but upside down.

{"body":"[Dear Desperate to Collaborate to Ensure Continued Employment as a Screenwriter,](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2jdlki/wp_link_your_favourite_submission_on/clazj5p)\n\nMore fodder for background - they say you're not supposed to talk about your ex's on a first date. But that's about all Wife #3 and me gabbed about, way back when, when we were freshly single.\n\nWe had seen each other around in the neighborhood. She had moved there soon after Husband #2, the lawyer, had pancaked at the bottom of some gorge. Rather, soon after the execution of his will. \n\nWell, every Saturday she would mow the lawn. I don't know what folks in the exclusive gated community found more eccentric: that she did her own yard work, or that she did it in a yellow bikini. \n\nSo, I spot her one day trimming the hedges through my bino's, and I couldn't help but notice the wild burning bush barely contained in the triangular patch of clothe between her legs. I mean curlieques sticking out. And I found that really hot. \n\nSo but one day around that time, I'm tailoring my yahoo singles search to gather profiles on wealthy widows. Up pops a pic of miss red head herself. I messaged her I had seen her IRL, and that I was close, real close, and she was all 'lol'd' and 'I'm calling the cops' and I said I had zip ties and handcuffs of my own, and we hit it off from there.\n\nWe went to some fancy place, $300 a plate swanky. She was sequins and pearls, I was cufflinked and dappered. We were exchanging histories of our respective social climbs, featuring four graves. Neither of us admitted to any culpability, but she spoke as dispassionately as the prison shrink says I do now. \n\nAnd there was this mantid aura about her. I suppose it was the way she plainspoke of her previous lesser halves, those deep black cylinders, windowed to her soul, where her eyes should have been. And she had said something, like, \"Wealth is for the willing.\" I liked that. That's when I first thought she may have been like minded. \n\nAnyway, I don't know what made me think to write you about this. Maybe it's the news of your divorce I found on a google search. So many marriages can't withstand the death of a child, though. Good for you sticking it out this long.\n\n[Hope this help feeds your imagination engine and remember, I'm the necessary evil.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1rrloe/wp_youve_just_killed_the_person_you_love_you_have/cdq8jx7) \n\nLL","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cm564cl","author":"LustLacker","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1416248611","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","link_id":"t3_2mjw0l","parent_id":"t3_2mjw0l","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1425980491","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cm564cl","subreddit":"WritingPrompts","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'Merican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. Yes.\n\nI get this reference. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You must be a hit at parties. I like you. Doctors *hate* you! Instructions unclear. Dick caught in you magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. As a black man and as a gay man and as a woman, black people suck, gay people are gross and women are bitches. You must be new to Reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once, and it's almost as if Reddit is composed of millions of individuals with different opinions and outlooks.\n\nThis stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today.

High sugar food will keep you fat for the inevitable famine. That's why it taste good, your taste buds are designed to make you crave it.\n\nThat sense of fullness you crave? Same thing: you're animal brain is telling you to do it or starve to death.\n\nThe thing is, constant fullness isn't possible. It's not supposed to be. Hunger is good for the brain and body. It triggers all sorts of hormones and neurotransmitters that keep you healthy. It's why out appetites grow over time. The more we eat the more we crave! Hunger is good.\n\nDon't purspue fullness. You're not going to starve. Don't pursue the whims of your tastebuds every time, they'll lead you crazy places.\n\nInstead practice pursuit of peace with hunger. Tie the feeling of hunger with an emotionally good place.\n\nIt sucks at first, not gonna lie. But it's necessary. Every other diest is either an attempt to short cut that, or get around it. But they never teach you to deal with the core issue: you're not in control of your fear of starvation.\n\nIt's just like fear of water, heights or spiders. They come from a rational place. Those are dangerous things. Unless you're on a safe boat, or behind a railing on bridge or the spider is harmless. Then those fears are irrational. With practice you can control them. Starvation is the same way, you're not at risk of starving, or going with out. Now it's time to practice controlling that fear.\n\nPractice being hungry, get used to the feeling and train yourself that it won't kill you.\n\n**Edit:** Crazy important point to add at this time. Make sure you don't actually starve yourself. I lost a lot of weight, but over a long period of time. I ate a healthy calorie deficit. What I'm talking about is beating *the fear of starvation*. That fear was one of the things that drove me to over eat. I was irrationally afraid that if I ate a healthy diet, If I was ever hungry, I would starve. Huger, especially when you're overweight, is normal when you switch to a healthy diet. We can't run from that.\n\n**Edit:** Pictures [before](http://i.imgur.com/CMNvd.jpg) &amp; [after](http://imgur.com/nX61WzU)","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cc6bkut","author":"nextwiggin4","author_flair_text":"","downs":"0","created_utc":"1378923757","subreddit_id":"t5_2rz8w","link_id":"t3_1m6am2","parent_id":"t3_1m6am2","score":"2329","retrieved_on":"1429499150","controversiality":"0","gilded":"3","id":"cc6bkut","subreddit":"loseit","ups":"2329","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":"120lbs","removal_reason":null}

{"body":"No one is going to see this I'm sure, but I was studying an MBA in Japan under one of the main consultants who was involved before that case blew up on the media.\n\nThe accounting fraud was committed back in 1989 by a man who is now dead. The current \"Olympus bosses\" were paying back the debt and fixing the books quietly over a 20 year span. \n\nJust before the debt was entirely paid off, the lid on this was blown off and it went public. The bad coverage forced the stock prices down and made the situation a lot worse for the company.\n\nAt any rate, the main reason they aren't doing jail time is because they didn't commit the crime, they just played ignorant while trying to pay it back. \n\nEDIT: Just to be clear, the fact they kept it quiet was still morally and legally wrong. At the same time, the fact they were paying it back also shows that this was done as damage control rather than an attempt to exploit investors. \n\nThe guy who blew the whistle was a competitive douche bag from the UK who they brought into the Japanese HQ. He knew about the situation for months, but ignored it until he wanted to make a power grab in the company. He used the scandal to get himself as much publicity as possible and had hopes to force some of the Japanese out of the company in the process. By being the hero, he'd be in a great position in the eyes of stockholders while advancing his career/personal agenda. It worked pretty well I'd say. \n\nWatch this and tell me you can't smell bullshit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4tSbgH0uP4","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cavt568","author":"UrusaiNa","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1372943400","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","link_id":"t3_1hmitl","parent_id":"t3_1hmitl","score":"1674","retrieved_on":"1430586286","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cavt568","subreddit":"worldnews","ups":"1674","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

The IAU, who is responsible for naming all celestial objects, DOES NOT take requests. You're just getting scammed.\n\nAnd...\n\n&gt; I've posted about this before, but more people (men) need to be aware of the Friendly Girls scam in Europe, especially eastern Europe and especially Budapest. \n\n&gt; Two or more women approach you asking for directions or offering directions. They aren't super-models, but they are reasonably attractive and seem nice and normal. They end up recommending a specific restaurant/bar/nightclub/whatever. You go with them. You have some drinks, maybe some food. Then the bill arrives and it's almost as much as your round-trip airfare. A large gentleman is there to \"help you pay up\". The girls act oblivious - this place sure is expensive! Gosh! \n\n&gt; If you can't come up with the cash, you will be \"assisted\" to an ATM to get the cash. If you refuse, the police will be called. Don't expect them to help. They're in on it. They will shrug and explain you must pay the bill. \n\n&gt; Guys: if some strange women approach you in a busy city center and beckon you to go to a specific place, DON'T. Either beg off or insist on taking them to a place of YOUR choosing. Try buying them some ice cream and see how they act. That should tell you all you need to know.\n\nAnd...\n\n&gt; Fafsa.com vs the actual http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/\n\n&gt; Fafsa.com charges you to file your FREE Application for Federal Student Aid. Might be a good idea to give this some attention with lots of students currently filing theirs. It actually takes less time to file the application through the actual .gov website.\n\nI don't mind this thread coming up again, though, because people need to be educated.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cacuwof","author":"TitaniumShovel","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1370463209","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_1fqopm","parent_id":"t3_1fqopm","score":"2820","retrieved_on":"1430914303","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cacuwof","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"2820","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Hi, Michael Goldstein here. I'm the co-founder of the Mises Circle, and I'm the one who edits and hits the publish button on the website.\n\nI'm sorry that you were so offended, /u/duckrageous, about our use of the Scrooge McDuck imagery on this article. For decades, Scrooge McDuck has been both playfully and maliciously the butt of many jokes concerning money, banking, and greed. Hoarding, you see, is not a very popular behavior in our world, including the Bitcoin world (as you can see below). That is why Daniel was kind enough to write a wonderful article liberating the act of hoarding from its public scorn, showing how it is actually the wellspring of economic growth. Praise be the hoarders! (And the hoadrs for that matter.)\n\nI know ducks have long been persecuted for their real and/or perceived monetary practices, but whether or not they all actually hoard like Scrooge McDuck, our hope was that this article would show that people should be *more* like Scrooge. The world would be a much better place if people saved more, and Bitcoin's success would happen at an even faster rate.\n\nI hope you understand.\n\nDisclosure: I am well known to be a duck myself, as my name suggests, and I have experienced many of the jokes you associate with that image of Scrooge diving into his room of Casascius coins. \"Where're your duckcoins, Duckstein?\" \"Yea, don't all ducks have tons of duckcoins? You control all the duckbanks anyhow.\" I'd always hope I'd find ways to counter these negative perceptions of myself and fellow ducks, and I really thought this article would be a step forward. C'est la vie. I guess it isn't rabbit season.\n\nBut speaking of that, here's a picture of me at a coffeeshop in Teal Aviv, the best city in the Holy Duck Land, that accepted duckcoins. I didn't spend much, though, because I wanted to hoard as many as possible.\nhttps://twitter.com/Bitstein/status/421650572522295297 ","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cfdz3lz","author":"bitstein","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1392257008","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3qj","link_id":"t3_1xqnaa","parent_id":"t1_cfdw9gz","score":"54","retrieved_on":"1432373782","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cfdz3lz","subreddit":"Bitcoin","ups":"54","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

Almost immediately after he just passes out and I can\u2019t wake him up.  He\u2019s breathing fine so I plan to just let him sleep it off.  I try to clean him up, put him to bed in the guest room, and then clean up myself and everything else.  I\u2019m not even done cleaning up the mess and I hear a commotion from his room.  Before I even go in I can smell that he shat himself.  I\u2019m getting pissed now, but know I have to bunker down and endure this because there\u2019s no way I can send him home now.  I change his clothes, start washing the sheets, and try to go to sleep myself.  But the rest of the night only got worse.  In short, he was up probably five or six times because he pissed himself or was making some commotion or another.  I never over-night babysat my 2 year old nephew again.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cd6injx","author":"Spartan2470","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1383580114","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_1pvhsn","parent_id":"t3_1pvhsn","score":"3623","retrieved_on":"1428795144","controversiality":"0","gilded":"2","id":"cd6injx","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"3623","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Ugh, I'm sick of seeing this thinly veiled pro-marijuana propaganda.\n\nThe biggest danger is getting caught with it? Really? Well, let me tell you a story.\n\nA good friend of mine - who had never been so much as drunk in his life - decided to try marijuana on his twenty-first birthday. He discovered that he enjoyed it, and started smoking in moderation. On Friday evenings (when he had the time and the money to spare), he'd light up his pipe with a few friends, and they'd all watch a bad movie together.\n\nNow, that sounds fine, right? Maybe it would have been, if it had stopped there. Unfortunately, my friend eventually discovered that he was *really good* at cooking while under the influence, and his little get-togethers soon included a selection of home-cooked food. Before long, people were requesting my friend's recipes, to the point where he decided to put together a cookbook. Then, in an effort to make this cookbook as high-quality as he could manage, my friend learned the basics of photography and took to documenting examples of the meals that he made. Before long, he had even taught himself some design skills... which, combined with the release of his cookbook, resulted in him getting a job offer at a publishing house.\n\nMy friend worked at that publishing house for close to a year and a half. He became well-liked and respected, and seemed to have a great career ahead of him... but then, one fateful morning, he stubbed his toe in the parking lot. According to my friend, it *hurt a little bit*, and he actually *scuffed his shoe*.\n\nAll because he'd smoked marijuana.\n\nDon't do drugs, kids.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cgcmzb4","author":"RamsesThePigeon","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1395863978","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7tt","link_id":"t3_21ftap","parent_id":"t3_21ftap","score":"1752","retrieved_on":"1433080941","controversiality":"0","gilded":"2","id":"cgcmzb4","subreddit":"AdviceAnimals","ups":"1752","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Growing up I had a best friend that I spent all of my time with.  I never really questioned how we became such good friends until after we discovered that we were siblings.  I remember the first time I ever met her.  My mom started babysitting Amy (let's just call her Amy) when I was 9 or 10 and really pushed for us to become friends even though I remember hating girls at the time.  I mean she was at the house everyday and my mom always made sure that we were getting along and having fun.\n\n\nFast forward to high school.  We became best friends over the years.  People always joked about how I was whipped, in the friendzone, other things like that.  Everyone just thought that I was waiting on her to come around.  But that wasn't the case at all.  Neither of us had any interest in anyone else other than each other.  It still blows my mind to this day because she was and still is one of the most attractive females I have ever seen and I have always just been an average looking guy.\n\n\nAmy would come over to the house everyday after school.  We would go out to the city on the weekends after I got a car.  We never made contact with each other and we never discussed how we felt about each other but we always knew.\n\n\nOne night, in the spring of our senior year, Amy and I went pool hoping with a few friends from the neighborhood.  It as cold!  We ran back to my house and climbed back in through the window like we always did.  She started to strip and I wasn't surprised, I had seen her naked many times.  But this night as different.  The vibes were unique to our friendship.   I started to take off my clothes also, to change.  Then we made eye contact and I guess you could say \"it was on.\"\n\n\nThe funny thing about it is that we were both virgins and it was still the wildest sex I have ever had to date.  All the sex that followed was never as good as it as that night.  \n\n\nThings were never awkward after that.  At school and home we acted the same except we would have sex when no one was around.  We never discussed dating or anything but I think that we both knew that we were in a relationship and that was all that mattered.\n\n\nI asked Amy to prom and she said yes.  My mom wanted to take all of these pictures so I picked up Amy, got \"the talk\" from her father figure (not her father I will explain), and then went back to my house.  My mom took all of these pictures and made a comment that I will never forget but it had no meaning at the time.  She said, \"Seeing you two together after all of these years has made me the happiest mother.  Amy, even though you're not my daughter you've always felt like one.\"  Then Amy and my mom cried together before we left for prom.\nWe graduated.  That day after all of the lunches with the relatives and after all of my annoying friends left, Amy ended up at my house.  My mom had been in a weird mood all day but I just thought it was because I was graduating.  Late in the afternoon Amy and I returned from somewhere (the gas station I think) and both of our mothers were sitting on the couch.  This wasn't strange but we were told to sit immediately after walking into the house.\n\n\nWe all sat around talking and laughing for a few minutes.  It was a happy conversation.  Then my mom spoke up.  She started to cry as she told us how happy that Amy and I make her.  How our friendship has kept her positive through the years after my father died.  \n\n\nSorry, reddit I guess now is the best time to tell you that I never met my dad and Amy's dad had also died before she met him.  We always thought this was interesting but we never talked about it.  Ever.  I don't think we saw the point because neither of us had a father.\n\n\nBack to \"the talk.\"  Amy's mom was pretty silent through all of this.  No tears, no comment, nothing.  Neither of our mothers knew that we had been having sex and pseudo dating.  Then my mom started talking about my dad and said, \"When I was pregnant, before your father died I learned that he as seeing another woman.  But I was never able to figure out who she was and after your father died I really didn't care anymore.\"\n\n\nThe conversation got a little serious at this point and I didn't really understand the purpose.  She continued for a few minute talking about my dad and then said, \"It wasn't until last summer that Carrie (We will call Amy's mom) and I discovered that we had both dated your father before the two of you were born.\"\n\n\nI remember responding with \"That's kind of weird or something like that.\"  And then it hit me.  I looked over at Amy and she had the most horrified face that I have ever seen.  The worse part is that she looked mad at me.\nMy mom continued to explain for a moment before saying, \"Carrie and I believe that you two are brother and sister.\"\n\n\nAmy asked, \"How can you be sure?\"\n\n\nThen my mom pulled out two letters.  One addressed to her and the other to Carrie.  And she said, \"These are from your father.\"\n\n\nAmy started to cry.  She always cried the same growing up and I never saw her cry like this.  She was shaking and turning extremely red.  I think he was even having trouble breathing.  My mom and Carrie tried to consult her before she ran out.\n\n\nThey ended up following her.  It was just me in an empty room with two twenty year old letters.  I snatched up the one written to my mom.  I read it.  My dad confessed to seeing another woman and getting her pregnant as well (I am just a few weeks older).  My dad said that he wanted to do the right thing and be there for both of his kids and that he understand the ramifications of his actions.  Then I read Carrie's letter.  It was short and my father explained that he made an error in judgment but he was not going to leave Carrie alone.  He wanted to raise his child with her as well.\n\n\nAfter reading these I was shocked.  I just sat there for hours until my mom finally came home.  I didn't know what to say to Amy, or if I could even ay anything to her.  I sat there for hours talking to my mom about dad and Amy.  \n\n\nTwo days later Amy called and she wanted to talk.  She came over and we laid in bed all day just talking like always.  She told me how much she loved me and that she always saw a future with us.  It was a bummer.  I was heartbroken because I was getting dumbed but I couldn't fight it because I didn't know how I felt.  Even after we talked about everything she never left.  Not a single day passed that summer that she wasn't with me.\nThere was still a lot of physical attraction and we acted on it often.  Sometimes we would laugh afterwards, sometimes we would cry and discuss society and how no one would understand.\n\n\nIt was the best summer of my life.  But then she left.\n\n\nWe talked about going to the same college.  We both applied and got in.  I was ready to go and so was she.  The night we were set to leave she arrived with no bags, none of her things, just a letter.  She handed it to me and walked away.  I tried to stop her to figure out what was going on but she didn't say a word.  I walked with her all the way back to her house trying to get her to speak but she wouldn't.\n\n\nWe reached her door, she grabbed my hand and just said, \"Remember that month that we binged watch the first few seasons of One Tree Hill?\"\n\n\nI nodded.  This would have been freshman year of high school.  She hated One Tree Hill and made so much fun of me for liking I but she always sat there with me anyways.\n\nShe continued, \"That's when I fell in love with you.\"  She kissed me and walked inside.\n\n\nI walked home heartbroken and confused.  I was supposed to leave for college the next day and I didn't know if I even wanted to.  \n\n\nThe next day came.  I decided that I was leaving but I wanted to say bye to Amy so I went to her house.  She had already left and Carrie asked why Amy didn't tell me she was leaving for a school that I had no idea she applied to.  I had no clue. \n\n\nI didn't read Amy's letter until that night.  I have had a rough time since then.  She has also.  We have spoken since.  Rarely, about us but mostly about wanting to see each other and move back home.\n\n\nOriginally, this post was meant to be comical but halfway through it I realized that I wasn't laughing.  I miss her.  Now I don't know if I want to post this and where I should if.\n\nTLDR: Fell for my best friend, starting having sex, made plans, found out she was my sister, had sex, we both left\n \n\n**UPDATE AND THANKS** \n\nI just want to thank everyone for all of the positive things you have had to say today.  I have spent most of the day talking with some of you and the responses I have received were all very unexpected.  I didn't think anyone would read this and I never expect so many of you to be as supportive as you have been.  So I want to say thanks.  Thank you all so much for giving me inspiration and the courage to fight for someone I care so much about.  I don't know how else to thank you because it has been a very emotional day for me.  I appreciate the gold.  I don't deserve it at all but I am going to pay-it-forward.  Not only am I going to gift it but I purchased 4 gold on my main account to do the same.  I think there are a lot more people on reddit who could really use a pick-me-up and I hope that I can do that for them just like you all have done for me.  I have been a member of the reddit community for nearly two years and I have always loved the fact that the community comes together to support people who are only looking for an outlet.  I never expected to be on the receiving end and again **THANK YOU** all so much.  \n\nAmy was actually the person who introduced me to all of you great people.  She still gets on here occasionally so if she ever discovers this post then I hope she reads it all to see all of the positive things that you have all had to say.\n\nMany of you think this is a great love story but this is just the direction that my life took.  I have no regrets other than I just let her walk away.  But I don't believe that it is over and we are still very close.  Many of you have asked for updates and maybe I will be able to deliver someday.  I am not a writer so the highly requested book will never happen.  I apologize for that but hell if I ever do tell the whole story it will be free for all of you.\n\nAs for the letter.  It tells a story more beautiful than I ever will.\n\nSeriously reddit, thank you!","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cffzt75","author":"throwawaybirdshit","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1392478939","subreddit_id":"t5_2s7tt","link_id":"t3_1xzi4l","parent_id":"t3_1xzi4l","score":"2013","retrieved_on":"1432408996","controversiality":"0","gilded":"4","id":"cffzt75","subreddit":"AdviceAnimals","ups":"2013","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Here's the thing. You said a \"jackdaw is a crow.\" Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying \"crow family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people \"call the black ones crows?\" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

{"body":"I did something like this in high school. There was this kid in my class who I couldn't stand. He had a stupid face, a stupid laugh, a sense of humor that consisted of quoting things out of context that were funny once a long time ago, he smelled bad, and he wouldn't stop following my friends and I around. Every moment with him around was an awkward, nerve-grating hell.\n\nNow, he'd had a crush on one of my friends since before highschool and, as it turned out, she had a little bit of a thing for me. He had absolutely no chance of ever dating her but, just like in his attempts to hang out with us, he showed no signs of ever giving up. I knew that seeing her flirt with me was already fucking with his head in a major way, so I decided to start flirting back.\n\nShe wasn't exactly bad looking and was pretty popular with the guys, but I didn't have any interest in her except as a friend. I told myself that flirting was harmless, though, so I started playing pretend and pretty soon there were rumors all around the school that we were dating. I denied all of them, I wasn't willing to go that far with a girl who I had no real interest in, and there were a few other chicks that I occasionally flirted with, so I wanted to keep my options open. In case you haven't caught on by now, 'asshole' doesn't even begin to describe what I was like back then.\n\nYou probably know how this ends. I was sitting pretty, while everybody else got shafted. The girl wanted me to make a move already, while I was content with holding this pretty little trophy wrapped around my finger in the faces of all the boys, with no real work or commitment from me. The kid that I hated never got any more comfortable with seeing her all over me, and I got off on watching him die a little bit inside every time the three of us were around each other. She and I were an annoying \"couple\" at the best of times, and I would play it up in front of him for kicks. To cap it all off, my best friend had secretly been pining for her for even longer than the guy I hated. I didn't know that when I started, but it quickly became obvious. Did I say anything or hesitate the slightest bit to consider his feelings? Hell no, I even started to enjoy watching him trying to act casual around us, while I could clearly see in his eyes that his heart was breaking.\n\nI was amassing a shitton of negatve karma and ill-will like they were cold war nukes, and I got my payoff after a little over a year of this. She got fed up with my bullshit, as well she should have, and grew distant. By Christmas of that year, we barely saw each other, quite a feat in our small school. The kid I hated left about when she did, just stopped trying to socialize with anyone except his books and his computer. I stayed friends with my former best friend, but we'd both lost respect and trust for each other, and our joking could border on abusive sometimes. I had a very lonely rest of that school year, which gave me quite a lot of time to ponder what kind of fucked up, pathetic, manipulative shithead I'd turned into. It took me a while to stop feeling sorry for myself and to base my identity and confidence on myself as a person again instead of how I was percieved by other people and what kind of power I held over them. I learned some really valuable lessons from that period of my life, but they probably could have been learned with a little less pain from everyone involved.\n\nTL;DR faked a relationship with a girl to bully some kid, lost the two best friendships I'd ever had at that point. Not a feel good story like all the other ones in here, but it showed me what pettiness and playing with people's feelings will get you.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c6v835i","author":"King_Ignatz","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1351839334","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_12he9h","parent_id":"t1_c6v2apv","score":"16","retrieved_on":"1430299466","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c6v835i","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"16","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

These two lessons gave you all the necessary training to begin fencing against other people.  Eventually, you'll probably be asked to begin paying a monthly fee to be part of the club, and you'll want to pick up your own equipment (~$100-$400, depending on the quality of the gear).\n\nJust Google fencing clubs in your area and call them to ask if you can come try it out.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_chbucw9","author":"LegendaryPrimate","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1399473996","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_24xzjs","parent_id":"t1_chbs35s","score":"1472","retrieved_on":"1433690305","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"chbucw9","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"1472","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

I'm also speaking to a few people in the Ministry of Manpower to get the boss in the video a taste of his medicine. \n\nI've got a million PMs asking why am I offering a job to somebody I don't know or haven't met. My answer: \n\n(a) It's my call, it's my business and I can do whatever I feel is right, but more importantly;\n\n(b) he's already an intern/on a job in the other company. That means he already has gone through the process of hiring. That also means he has atleast some basic qualifications for a job. This is Singapore - so I'm willing to bet that guy is probably more than qualified for a job at Deskera. I say that because Singaporeans are(mostly) outstandingly hardworking and the ones who have a job/internship have been cherry picked. \n\n\n\nI'm also getting a lot of messages asking me for a job. It would be a lot better if you could drop me more than a few lines about yourself. Join my sub /r/deskera  and post about yourself. \n\n\nLastly, I'm also getting a bunch of hate-mail and threats.

{"body":"Its a proven scientific fact that Windmills never produce enough energy to make up for the energy spent making the windmill\n\nFrom a cost point of view the only thing worse than wind turbines are solar panels. That is why electricity generators don't install turbines unless they get subsidized access to the grid. Where I live, the market price for electricity averages about 5-cents a kilowatt hour. The government guarantees wind producers 14 to 18 cents per kwh. Thus the market subsidizes wind. Solar is even worse. The government guarantees solar producers 45 to 80 cents per kwh.\nIn addition to being hard on the wallet, wind and solar are not reliable. The don't produce electricity when the wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining. Both are a very bad investment.\nMany people think it is worth the cost because wind and solar are renewable. Unfortunately this is really just \"feel-good environmentalism.\" For the small amount of electricity turbines and panels produce, they require a lot of resources and some very polluting techniques to manufacture.\nStick with hydro and nuclear. Invest in clean coal and carbon sequestration.\n\nFrom http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100220110953AA8wRwK\n\nPretty sure Popular Science had an article about this too that said Windmills are not cost effective, I'll try to find it in my house and take a photocopy\n\n\nedit: could not find the popular science article but with a little scrounging found this study on the web with plenty of sources and information taken from scientific evidence. http://www.aweo.org/problemwithwind.html\n\nNow I agree we should still be researching solar and wind power, but as it stands the resources and energy used to make our current wind turbines are not cost effective. \n\nheres another:  \"It almost always costs more to generate your own electricity than it does to buy it from the power grid. Just the cost of batteries alone can often break down to a monthly cost greater than you'd have paid had you bought the same power from the grid. These costs can vary, and if you buy surplus/used equipment that can change your overall cost per kilowatt-hour (kwh) dramatically in an off grid system.\"\nhttp://www.otherpower.com/bottom_line.shtml\n\nand here is another article from forbes with sources and links to studies done:http://www.forbes.com/2011/07/19/wind-energy-carbon.html\n\nwhy do i get downvoted? I provided sources and facts, not one of you have provided the an argument.\n\n\"he wind energy business is the electric sector's equivalent of the corn ethanol scam: it's an over-subsidized industry that depends wholly on taxpayer dollars to remain solvent while providing an inferior product to consumers that does little, if anything, to reduce our need for hydrocarbons or cut carbon dioxide emissions. The latest Bentek study should be required reading for policymakers. It's a much-needed reminder of how the pesky facts about wind energy have been obscured by the tsunami of hype about green energy.\"\n\nNow if you want to argue Conservation vs Generation that is another argument but as it stands they are simply not cost effective right now\n\nwhy am i getting downvoted?

As a 'Merican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. Yes.\n\nI get this reference. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You must be a hit at parties. I like you. Doctors\u00a0hateyou! Instructions unclear. Dick caught in you magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F \"about tree fiddy\" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"? Nice try, you monster. What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. As a black man and as a gay man and as a woman, black people suck, gay people are gross and women are bitches. You must be new to Reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once, and it's almost as if Reddit is composed of millions of individuals with different opinions and outlooks.\n\nThis stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a bundle of sticks, 2/10, would not bang, not with that attitude. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! I really sympathize with pedophiles, but that has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now.

{"body":"When I was in second grade I had a friend named Joe who had the worst mom of all time, in helicopter mom terms.  She was so overprotective that she once tried to sue the junior baseball league in our area because Joe had struck out one time and didn't get to run the bases.\n\nDuring lunchtime at my elementary school, you got your lunch sooner if your last name was higher up in the alphabet.  His last name was Adams and he always got lunch first, however when we entered 3rd grade they changed the system so you got lunch dependent on your first name.  Since his name was \"Joe\" he was somewhere in the middle.  \n\nJoe didn't give a shit.  He was a very laid back kid for a 3rd grader, he wasn't really hyper like the other kids and he wasn't a crybaby either.  Now that I think about it, he was quite mature, in fact he was happy that he wasn't first anymore so now he wasn't always done with his lunch first.\n\nThe first few weeks of 3rd grade were fun, then somehow I guess Joe let it slip that he was no longer first in the lunch line anymore to his mom.  His mom flipped the fuck out and LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO \"ADAM\".  His name was now legally Adam Adams.  Why?  All so he could be first in the lunch line.\n\nThe only time I ever saw Joe/Adam cry was because of this, he came to school crying the day when he got his name changed 3rd graders being 3rd graders... everyone made fun of him for his new, ridiculous name which ended up making him cry even more.\n\nI was a very shy 3rd grader, but I felt absolutely terrible for Joe,  my 3rd grade brain decided I had to do something about it.  He was at the front of the lunch line for a few weeks and then his mom came to pick him up from school for a doctors appointment or something, I don't even remember.  But I remember that I walked up to his mom and said in my high squeaky 3rd grade voice, \"Why did you change Joe's name? He doesn't like being called 'Adam'\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, this sent Joe's mom in a rage.  The teacher was out of class making copies or something so she wasn't there to defend me.  Joe's mom started screaming at me telling me that Joe was very happy with his new name and that I know nothing about her son.  This set off some little bomb in me and I remember screaming at her back telling her that she was a terrible mommy and she should be sad that she makes Joe so upset.\n\nThe class was dead silent other than me and her yelling at each other, a few kids started crying and to be honest I was a pussy in 3rd grade (still am) and I started crying while I was yelling at her too.  \n\nThe teacher must have heard, she came running into the classroom worrying what was going on.  She asked Mrs. Adams what she was doing in the classroom and ordered her to come out in the hall to sort things out, Mrs. Adams then started screaming at her and me saying that I was a little shit who thinks I know more than she does.  My teacher ordered me into the hall too so everyone could talk things over.\n\nMeanwhile Joe's sitting in his seat reading while everyone else was scared and worried about what was happening, this has nothing to do with the story, I just included it because I still think it's pretty badass that he didn't give a damn.\n\nAnyways, we go out in the hall with my teacher obviously furious, me more scared than I'd ever been in my life, and Mrs. Adams who can't shut her mouth.  \n\nMy teacher tries to calm Mrs. Adams and tries to convince her to tell her side of the story.  She does.  Then she tells me to tell my side of the story (Which I can't do because Mrs. Adams interrupts me every few words).  While my teacher is standing there thinking about what to do Mrs. Adams just breaks down and starts crying her eyes out. \n\nI was shocked, as was my teacher at this, when asked what's wrong Mrs. Adams tell us (more specifically my teacher, I just happened to be there) about how she was abused and neglected as a child and she just wanted to make Joe feel important and loved.  After about 10 minutes of her crying and ranting about this subject I started to feel pretty bad.  I'd cooled down by now and I felt so guilty and bad because I'd never stood up to an authority figure before.\n\nI'm standing awkwardly listening while Mrs. Adams tells my teacher her whole life story.  When she's done, she looks over at me and says, \"I'm sorry I got mad at you, I don't know if you were listening to what I told your teacher, but I'm so sorry for yelling at you, I just want Joe to be happy.\"\n\nSurprised at her sudden change of heart, I decided to apologize too for getting mad at her.  She told me something like, \"You have the right to be mad at me, and if what you say is true so does Joe, I just need you to be nice to Joe please.\"\n\n3rd grade me doesn't really care about her feelings so I say, \"Ok\" and try to walk back to class, before I can open the door she says, \"Wait, I need one more thing?\" Kind of annoyed, I ask, \"What do you need?\"  \"I need about tree fiddy\"\n\nIt was around this time I realized Mrs. Adams was 7 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleolithic era.  That damned Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! \"Damnit, Monstah, I ain't given you no tree fiddy\" I yelled as she swam away.\n\nJoe moved after that and I never saw Mrs. Adams or Joe again.  But I have the feeling that she's still an overprotective bitch and will always be one.\n\ntl;dr: Friend's mom is an overprotective bitch, I get mad at her for being an overprotective bitch.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c5pniko","author":"Thehealeroftri","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1344373804","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_xu7ju","parent_id":"t3_xu7ju","score":"1643","retrieved_on":"1429578014","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c5pniko","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"1643","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"I met Jen an June through my friend John back in high school. John had been dating Jen for several weeks, and we were all hanging out at the mall. Jen was cute and seemed to be interested in me, but since she was dating John, I decided to focus my attention on June. Things worked out well. Very well. :D\n\nSome time passes, and Jen and John split. I was still dating June. Jen's parents were gone for the day, and we figured we'd just hang out over there. I got there a bit early, and Jen and I engaged in the usual random teenage chatter about absolutely nothing in particular. Being a heavy flirt, I start commenting about how good looking Jen is. She replies in kind, making no bones about the fact that she wanted me.\n\"Yeah...I don't think June would appreciate me screwing her best friend.\" I said.\n\n\"You'd be surprised. I can convince her of a lot of things.\" she said with a wink. At this point, I'm actually pretty sure she was just joking around.\n\nSo June shows up a few minutes later. We were still in that early stage of the relationship where we can't keep our hands off each other; Jen put the music on and sat on the chair while June and I were laying on her bed half paying attention to Jen and half making out. June whispers to me \"God the things I want to do to you right now...\". I don't think Jen was supposed to hear it, but she did. And she chimed in. \"So what's stopping you?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to just sit here and blow my boyfriend in front of you. I'm pretty sure you don't want to see that.\" June said.\n\n\"Oh, come on. It'll be fun. Heck, we can all have a little fun.\" Jen said.\nAll this time, I'm just laying there. There was no way I was going to cut off the opportunity for a threesome, but at the same time I didn't want to essentially say that I wanted to fuck my girlfriend's best friend either.\n\nJune was caught off-guard for a second, not sure what to make of the situation.\n\n\"Just do it, June. If I start doing anything to him you don't want me to do, let me know. I'll stop.\"\n\nThis went back and forth for a couple of minutes. I have to say....two girls negotiating over what they will and won't do with me was one hell of an ego boost for a 17 year old kid. :D Again, I didn't want to say anything, but while they were debating this, she was still laying on the side of me. I had eventually snuck my hands into her shirt and was playing with her tits, which was keeping her turned on. I'm not sure if she would have gone through it anyway, but I think she was too horny to say no.\n\nShe eventually agreed. We resumed making out, and I had actually stopped paying attention to Jen for a couple of minutes. I had moved onto my back and June had moved down to my abdominal area, unzipped my pants, pulled my cock out, and started giving me a blow job.\n\nNext thing I realized, Jen was standing on the side of the bed, topless. She had leaned over to me and I took one of her tits in my mouth. She had started undoing her pants, and I think her idea was to climb onto my face. That's when we heard her parents' car pull into the driveway.Her parents had a strict no boys policy, and I'm pretty sure \"no group sex\" was also on that list. And here I am with their topless daughter and my dick in her friend's mouth. Yeah, this wasn't looking good.\n\nThe bedroom window had a fire escape, which I hid on. I couldn't actually leave the property for a few minutes, though; the entire yard was closed in and the only way on or off the property was to walk right by the living room window where I was sure to be seen. I had to actually wait and get a signal that neither parent was in the living room before I could make a mad dash off the property and down the street.\nJen did attempt to hint at trying again another time, but June was so shook up at almost getting caught the first time that there was no way that she was going to agree to a second try.\n\nThis depressed me greatly. It was and remains to this day the closest I ever have had to a threesome.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_chu12jx","author":"NightwingDragon","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1401376766","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_26si8v","parent_id":"t3_26si8v","score":"48","retrieved_on":"1434005070","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"chu12jx","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"48","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Ex-flight attendant here, day of the attempted shoe bombing a few years ago in London I was working in Chicago where flights had only just resumed. A lady in 1st class was steated next to a man reading a quran and dressed in traditional clothing. Just as we were about to do our safety announcement she gets up, walks down the aisle and taps me on the shoulder. She whispers to me \" We need to go back, the man next to me is reading from one of those books and how are we to know what it says?!?\". Took me a minute to realize who she was referring to, and asked to have the plane taken back to the gate. She refused to reurn to her seat and choose to sit in economy until we removed the passenger she was referring to. \nOnce we got back she was slightly surprised to find that I had organized for her (and not the man she was complaining about) to catch another flight later that day after she had calmed down. Meanwhile back on the aircraft another passenger in 1st class had asked to switch seats and be moved next to the man in question and proceeded to spark conversation in order to make him feel less embarassed for the unwarranted event. I cannot speak for what occured in Boston but I want people to know that this kind of thing happens more than you may think. TL;DR Woman wanted a muslim man removed from our flight, so we removed her. Simple as that. \n\nEdit:spelling","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c9gl81e","author":"nosayingbagpipe","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1366151454","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh3l","link_id":"t3_1cgy5y","parent_id":"t3_1cgy5y","score":"3173","retrieved_on":"1431533605","controversiality":"0","gilded":"4","id":"c9gl81e","subreddit":"news","ups":"3173","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"That is a fine specimen of the extinct deutschmark wallet. I don't know where it came from, but I put this common eagle head next to it for scale. A rare find indeed.\n\nSorry I guess I forgot my wallet could be mistaken for an expired currency. For scale, the wallet is 4in. wide, I think the eagle's head is about 5in. long.\n\n**As I was saying before my internet connection went down:**\n\nIt appears to be a golden eagle's head. I named him Eddard. Apparently it's been in our yard for a couple of months, my wife asked me to deal with it a couple of times but I'm lazy and it was doing no harm way back in a corner. Finally one of my dogs brought it to the patio. Wife thought it was a full-bodied dead small bird the entire time, until I asked her if she had seen the body. \n\nPretty unusual. I live downtown in a major metropolis. How would a golden eagle go about losing it's head? How would that head, and only the head, find it's way into my yard in the city? Does anyone have any insight into this? We do have occasional fox in the neighborhood. Would a fox have anything to do with decapitating poor Eddard?\n\nI'm also curious if anyone has any suggestions for preservation of this fine specimen. The eagle head, not the wallet, I can preserve my wallet just fine thank you.\n\nEdit: Because it became a topic of conversation; my wallet is made by [Dynomighty](http://www.dynomighty.com/mighty-wallet/). I's likes it purty gewd.\n","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c9ihtyv","author":"Ricksavage444","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1366387609","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh61","link_id":"t3_1coh7n","parent_id":"t3_1coh7n","score":"231","retrieved_on":"1431500634","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c9ihtyv","subreddit":"WTF","ups":"231","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Oh man...\n\nSo when I was 18 I was working in a gay club as a barback. I was pretty in shape from being young and physical, so I got hit on quite a bit, especially walking through the crowd carrying big cases of beer. guys would always comment on how strong I was and ask to squeeze my arms and shit.\n\nSo eventually one day a guy strikes up conversation with me while I'm slow one night and tells me all about how he's a photographer and shit, and how his models make a couple grand for shooting. I was pretty young and naive, so I asked him what it took to be a model.\n\nHe basically described me, and I was stoked and asked if I could do a shoot... he smiled and said of course, he'd love to. Couple days later I get to his studio and he has me try on all these different outfits... progressively getting skimpier. Finally he looks me dead in the eyes and says \"I will pay you $500 to let me suck your cock.\" Up until then I considered myself straight, but I was like, you know what, whatever. $500 is a decent amount of money, and I'm not actually blowing anyone or anything, so it's not AS gay... anyway, he sets the camera up and says it's part of the deal, so I said well if you're filming it will other people see it? He said no, it would be just for him. Well, that seems reasonable, considering he would have to get me to sign a release, so we get the show on the road.\n\nHe keeps almost getting me to climax then stops, and tells me eventually he'll make it $2,000 if he can put his finger in my butt while he blows me. Again, 2 grand is a lot of money to an 18 year old bar back, and I figure what harm can one finger do? Progressively it turns from 1, to 2, and next thing I know he's talked me into letting him fuck me.\n\nThe final scene is what really makes it though... he has me bent over, looking into the camera, and right before I let him finish in me he looks directly into the camera and says \"Use a serious tag next time, OP\" and BOOM goes the dynamite.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cpq0twr","author":"improbablyfullofshit","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1427268329","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_307djz","parent_id":"t3_307djz","score":"3457","retrieved_on":"1432000862","controversiality":"0","gilded":"2","id":"cpq0twr","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"3457","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Here's the thing. You said a \"peanut is a bean.\"\n\nIs it in the same family? Yes.

If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"legume family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Fabaceae (alternately Leguminosae), which includes things from lentils to beans to peanuts.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a peanut a bean is because random people \"call the edible ones beans ?\" Let's get coconuts and almonds in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A peanuts is a peanut and a member of the legume family. But that's not what you said. You said a peanuts is a bean, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the peanut family peanut, which means you'd call almonds, cashews, and other legumes beans, too.
