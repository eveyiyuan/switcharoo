{"body":"I was standing in line at the post office today behind two people having a conversation. Now I live in a fairly conservative town in Texas, so it wouldn't be unusual for two strangers to start talking about church and other religious topics. This really didn't bother me because I'm used to hearing and being in the presence of such conversations. However, they began talking about the school system and how the district was encouraging teachers to teach ESL (English as Second Language) if they were able to. They were so angry about it, and I being Mexican, began to feel a little uncomfortable. I can understand people wanting immigrants to make an effort to assimilate to the new culture, but again, what bothered me was the anger in their voice. The usual \"This is America; they should learn the language or leave\" junk began to spew out of their mouths. Nonsense led to more nonsense, and they began to talk about how soon, teachers will have to teach atheism in school and discourage any religious expression. Oh and one of them blamed it on Obama while the other just nodded in agreement. Finally, their turn was up, and I got called shortly after. As I drove home, I began having this sort of epiphany and not to sound cocky or conceited, but I found relief in knowing I was better than those people. Ever since I accepted there isn't a god, my perception of many things changed for the better. For some reason, I've grown more compassionate for all humanity, animals, and the world itself. I remember that night when I accepted reality that I went to my dog and talked to him and told him how much I loved him and how grateful I was that he loved me too. Hopefully I don't sound crazy but I told him I did not own him and that I knew that I was not better than him, just two different animals on the tree of life enjoying each others companionship. Anyway, point is this: It's time to step up. Time to look at ourselves and redefine our morals and our position on certain issues. Let's be the most humanitarian and compassionate human beings out there. Treat each other, animals and our planet with utmost respect for we do not have a \"Parent to care for us, to forgive us our errors, to save us from our childish mistakes.\" (Sagan) We don't have to boast about our beliefs. Instead, people will ask who we are - Who was that person that stood up for the gay kid in class? Who was that person who is tolerant of all cultures and understanding of people's struggles? Who was that person who fed the homeless man with a 'hungry' sign?- They will ask \"who is that person and of what religion are they?\" to which we will promptly reply \"I am Atheist.\" Strong. Then Kill.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c7j6ns9","author":"rufud","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1355944882","subreddit_id":"t5_2qpol","link_id":"t3_153wxz","parent_id":"t1_c7j3310","score":"35","retrieved_on":"1435656111","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c7j6ns9","subreddit":"circlejerk","ups":"35","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Hitting a horse or a cow can be serious, they are  very large animals and don't budge easily. I had a friend who was driving her SUV on some country roads and she came up over a hill and there was a horse in the road. She hit the horse and dented her car a tiny bit, but the horse was okay, just a little shaken up and was still standing in the road. She was pulled over calling 911 when she saw a truck coming. She started waving and honking her horn but the big truck came speeding along full force and hit the horse. The horse was hurt very bad and it died shortly after. The truck was so messed up from the impact it had to be taken away on a flat bed. The horse belonged to a family we went to high school with and the youngest daughter didn't shut the gate all the way which is how the horse got out. My friend was still in high school at the time and when everyone found out, they made fun of her and called her horse killer (very small country school). The family wasn't mad but she felt so terrible.

{"body":"My wife hired one. She found that she was wasting money, and that I'm a very boring person. \n\n\n\nedit: (I didn't expect anyone to read my reply) We came from different cultures, but we knew we wanted to be with each other. She's hispanic (born in another country), and I'm a hillbilly from Appalachia. There was a lot of jealousy early on (on both sides), because we simply couldn't relate. After a while, I grew tired of being suspicious, and told her that if she wanted to be with someone else to just tell me, and I'll move on, but just tell me. It was very freeing for me. I guess to her though it only made her more suspicious.\n\nI got off work at 7am, and there wasn't much to do, and not many places that were open for a couple more hours, so I would go to the gym. She worked an early 1st shift job, so we didn't see each other in the mornings. and I guess she didn't like not being able to account for the gap between me leaving work, and me coming back to the apartment. The guy she hired to follow me around was terrible. I had my routine get off work, go to the gym, go grab some breakfast, hit up Blockbuster, maybe go to a pet store (we had birds &amp; fish). At that time in the morning these places are empty. Like I said, I'm a boring person. \n\nCut to a few days later, I leave the gym and the new guy behind. Head to a restaurant, and in comes the new guy from the gym. Creepy. I eat then leave, go to Blockbuster, and in he comes. So here I am suspicious. The next day at the gym, I'm telling my buddy about how creepy it was for the new guy to show up everywhere I go, and he agrees. I'm done working out, and tell my buddy that I'm going to leave, and that I'm going to a specific pet store, and if the guy leaves the gym right after me, that my buddy should head to the same pet store. And that was what happened. I go to the store, a couple minutes later in walks the guy, and a minute after that in comes my buddy. We ended up pinning the guy to the floor, I asked why, and he starts saying that \"it's just a job,\" and that he \"aint seen nothing.\" We release him back into the wild, with the order that he's not to show up at the gym again. I get home call her up, and say that she hired the biggest idiot around, and that she needs to stop wasting money. She asks, \"what happened?\" I tell her to ask him, since she gave him money.\n\nHer jealousy died down after that. Well, that and I made the ultimate quote to her that made sense. I said, \"if I was getting laid as much as you think I am, wouldn't I be a lot happier?\" And that was that.\n\nFor those folks hoping for a different ending, sorry to disappoint. We've been together for almost a quarter of a century, and everything is fine. Maybe she just couldn't believe that she was involved with someone so boring.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cey9lj9","author":"sourmilksmell","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1390618049","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_1w28fw","parent_id":"t3_1w28fw","score":"3179","retrieved_on":"1432096459","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cey9lj9","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"3179","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

As he went from spot to spot, he was to replace the brick at each spot with another one that he was carrying. He was to answer no questions, speak to no one, and seem to be deaf and dumb. Once an hour, he was to enter the museum, walk right next to the ticket taker, seem to pay the fee, and then proceed through the museum and out the door.

This was in the late 90s, and I wrote a program that would scan the logs monthly looking for certain keywords my boss provided me with.  It would then return the top users along with the URLs that matched.  We would turn in the worst offenders to their supervisors.  We would get funny false positives, like the fans of the South Carolina Gamecocks would be caught.\n\n\nIt was amazing the stuff people were into, and would look for at work.  The worst ones (as anyone would expect) were cops.  I mean like bestiality, torture, pedophilia.  Apparently some were doing it as part of their job and would be exempted.  Others definitely were not.  \n\n\nAnother interesting thing was that no woman ever came up on the list, except once.  I told my boss a woman was the top porn surfer for that month and he absolutely refused to believe it.  She was investigated, and it was discovered there were entries at times she wasn't at work.  She had given her ID and password to a contractor she had felt sorry for.\n\n\nEventually we went to a more proactive system, and I was relieved of that worst of tasks.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c9bqbgb","author":"StevieDedalus","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1365531634","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_1bzze1","parent_id":"t3_1bzze1","score":"350","retrieved_on":"1431617673","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c9bqbgb","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"350","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"I used to drive I-80 between San Francisco and Cheyenne, Wyoming a lot. It's about 16-20 hours of driving depending on weather and traffic and whatever. \n\nAnyway, one time I got out at a rest stop to stretch my legs and take a piss, maybe buy a coke. I go into the bathroom and there are three beefy, bearded guys all naked from the waist down just lying on the ground blowing each other in a daisy chain. I looked at them, and two of them looked up at me, cocks in respective mouths, and one of them kept going and the other one's eyes went wide as hell. I just said \"Er, sorry.\" and walked right back outside. Oddly, all I could think of was \"Wow, that floor is probably filthy.\"\n\nA second time I was driving at night and the car starts making this odd grinding noise. Like I ran over something that got stuck. It's about 2am. I pull into a rest stop (well-lit) and wake up my buddy who was sleeping. I explain it to him, as we get out of the car we both hear what sounds like a kid crying. There are no other cars at the rest stop, but we frequently heard stories about child trafficking and kidnapping nearby, so we decided to check it out. We grab our flashlights and head towards the noise, which is coming from the bathrooms. \n\nAs we get closer we realize it's coming from the women's bathroom, and it's a low, dull sobbing. We are prepared for the worst. We walk in expecting to see some brutally beaten and/or raped 8 year old or something, and we see - nothing. The sound is still there, and it's still clearly coming from the room, but the room is empty. We turn on the lights - still nothing. Check each stall, the trash can. Nothing. Even start looking for WHERE in the room it's coming from - nothing. Is it a hidden speaker? Are we on candid camera? What the fuck? \n\nMy buddy climbs up one of the stalls to get to the top window in the rest stop which is vented out, and open. He closes it, and the noise stops. Completely. Opens it, and there's no more noise. We sit there for a few seconds, staring at each other. He shrugs. Then the window slams shut again without him touching it.\n\nWe were out of that fucking bathroom in seconds. The noise starts up about 10 seconds later as we get to the car, and we're tearing out of the parking lot within 10 more seconds. The grinding noise is still there. So this time I pull over a few miles later at a Flying J Truck Stop, well-lit, sometimes occupied. Couple of truckers there, no other \"civilians\" like us. We check under the car. There's a red and silver piece of metal wedged between part of the car and the road, about 1/2\" or so off the ground, so with us in the car it would definitely have been grinding against the ground. Can't remove it by hand, it's really wedged in there, so we kick at it to bend it and figure we'll remove it when we get back.\n\nA week later I had my mechanic take it out when he was doing a service - it was part of a kid's tricycle. The red area where somebody can stand, like on the back of this:\nhttp://www.photo-dictionary.com/photofiles/list/483/863tricycle.jpg\n\nI don't know why, and I don't think they were connected or anything, but that was one of those moments for me. Totally fucked up and crazy.\n\n**EDIT:** My buddy emailed me this. \"Hey man, I saw this on reddit (link removed). Is this you? I was thinking about this the other day. I think it was coyotes. I heard some coyotes outside the cabin last month and they were like kids laughing or roughousing and later on they were kind of crying and it sounded familiar. I don't know why it was coming from the bathroom. Maybe the drains in the floor were connected to where the coyotes were howling? Maybe the window or the wind or just the way the noise was carrying over the desert or bouncing off the walls? I don't know. But I think it was coyotes. It sounded just like it.\"\n\n\n\n","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c8dh1x9","author":"gaqua","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1360620478","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_18bq6h","parent_id":"t3_18bq6h","score":"1909","retrieved_on":"1431263491","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c8dh1x9","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"1909","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

The King James version here roughly says \"If you believe in what you say and don't doubt yourself, it will happen.\" The NIV version fundamentally changes this by switching \"it will happen\" to \"it will be done for you\".

{"body":"It's a long story, but I'll try to make it quick. A guy followed my friends and me from middle school and idled when we stopped walking (we had to spilt up). Seems weird, but not too weird. We chat for a while. The guy never leaves the car. I realize that the windows, even the driver's side one, is tinted (which is illegal in my state). We talk for 15+ minutes. He doesn't move. I pull out my cell phone to tell my mom I'm going to be late. The guy peels away and that's when we noticed he had no plates. \n\nTo make it worse, my best friend was going to walk four blocks to her empty house, because her dad didn't come home till 5. And she barely weighs 110 lbs. I have no doubt she would have been abducted if I hadn't taken out my phone. \n\nEDIT: For all the people asking if I told my parents, I did. Eventually. Years later. My mom was really freaked out when I told her. She's a psychotherapist and her speciality is the family members of murder victims. \n\nWhy didn't I tell anyone? Because I never connected the dots until years later. My best friend (the one who's dad came home late) didn't even remember it. I just pushed it to the back of my mind as a weird thing, until a guy who drove a very similar car exposed himself to my cousin in the adjacent neighborhood. Now that I'm older I have more of an awareness of all the terrible things that happen to kids.\n\nIn retrospect, it should have been more obvious that something was wrong, especially since my parents were always clear to stay away from strangers. The thing I thing we need to learn from this is to educate kids to stay together and keep a cell phone with them. I have also learned basic cell defense, and I always carry a rape whistle with me just in case.

{"body":"The worst thing I have ever done was pretty recent and I'm trying like hell to figure out a way to fix it without destroying my life.\n\nLong story short, I cheated on my wife... how I did it makes it so much more terrible.\n\nTo put this all in perspective, my wife is very close to her brother... they are fraternal twins and have been inseparable their whole lives.  Because of this I have gotten to know my brother in law and his wife quite well.  One night my brother in law was out of town on business so we had his wife over for dinner.  My wife got called in to work (she is a Nurse in an ER) and so me and my sister-in-law were sitting at the house along talking and drinking wine by my pool.  After a few glasses some horseplaying lead to her falling in.  While her clothes were in the drier we sat and talked with her in nothing but a towel.  I don't know how it got started since we had gotten pretty drunk but the towel ended up coming off and the next thing I know we were having sex.\n\nI wish we could just pretend it never happened and get on with our lives but unfortunately she got pregnant.  Her and her husband had been trying for a while but apparently his equipment hadn't been up to the task, he had been gone for a week by the time me and her slept together so we are fairly sure it is mine.  He was with her when she got morning sickness and made her take a pregnancy test, he is out of his mind excited and has already told everybody.  We have somehow kept our cool so far and nobody suspects anything, but sooner or later it will come out.  Especially since my wife and her brother are Asian and both me and my sister in law are white.  She is now 4 months along and to compound things more my wife is currently 3 months pregnant.  \nI don't know what to do, I can't sleep and every day is torture while I wait for my life to implode around me. \n\nTL:DR I got both my Asian wife and white sister-in-law (my wife's brother's wife) pregnant within a month of each other.\n\nEdit:  I work for her father's business... so in a few months I'll be an unemployed father of 2.\n\nEdit 2: Grammar (thanks  IISpadezII)\n\nEdit 3: An abortion was considered however where we are located abortions are not legal and she has no plausible excuse to travel somewhere to get one.\n\nEdit 4: A lot of people are calling me a piece of shit, saying I deserve what I am getting... hasn't anybody woken up the morning after drinking and found out that you did something you completely regret?  This feels like that x100.  I'm also not just concerned for myself like many people accuse either, this will be totally devastating to the entire family and to make matters worse it isn't like they can just kick us out of their lives like we deserve, they will have a constant reminder of the betrayal.  With all the pain it would cause I am somewhat considering doing what many people consider the evil thing and just praying nobody finds out.  People say what I did is evil and lying about it is worse but I am where I am now, I can't change that I just want to make sure as little further pain comes of this as possible.  I will suffer for the rest of my life, and so will my sister in law... isn't that enough?\n\nTo make matters worse I have realized that until I made this post I had almost suppressed the whole thing.  I mean I had to work so hard to act like I was happy for them, that everything was fine that I had almost convinced myself.  I had been drinking a lot but it wasn't until I started writing this that all my emotions really came to the surface.  I hadn't actually been trying to figure out a way to fix it... I had been avoiding it.  I haven't even talked to my sister in law about it since a week or two after they found out she was pregnant.  I decided I'm going to talk to her today, we have to make sure we are on the same page and agree on where to go from here.  Maybe afterwords Ill do an AMA like some people have asked, it is really kind of a relief to actually finally talk about this.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c6rr4yv","author":"TerribleGuyTA","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1351200248","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_122it6","parent_id":"t3_122it6","score":"2881","retrieved_on":"1430239336","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c6rr4yv","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"2881","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"I was 3 months away from 20 when I found out my dad wasn't my biological father. Shit was intense.\n\n**Edit for the story**: My mom got pregnant when she was 20 right when breaking up with her boyfriend. She met a guy, and supposedly, they fell in love and decided to get married within 3 months of knowing each other. They passed me off as his own to his side of the family (only he and his brother knew the truth, my mom's side of the family all knew). I've always had his last name since the second I came into this world. In order \"to provide a better life for me,\" they decided to never tell me and only sent updates to my biological father through my aunt (so it couldn't be tracked via postage). With the advent of the Internet, they switched to email. My aunt forgot to delete my mom's email address one time during the forwarding, so my biological father got it and hired a PI to track us down. Keep in mind, he always wanted to have contact with me but wasn't given the option by my mother. Anyway, he contacted her with my info that he got from the PI and said that either she could come clean or that he would just show up at my dorm one day (I was a sophomore in college during this). She chose to tell me first, and I met him a few days later. I felt bad for the guy, but I haven't and probably won't ever forgive my mother for keeping that from me in the first place. In my opinion, it wasn't her decision to make. My dad always favored my younger sister while growing up, and they (my mom and dad) vehemently denied it, but it turns out I was right (she later confirmed that for me when confessing by saying it was the source of almost all of their fights until their divorce when I was 14). There you go, the whole story to how I found out that my dad wasn't my biological father. I didn't exactly respond to the knowledge well. I was dealing with some depression at the time, and it just helped spin me down to an even darker place. I abused alcohol for sure, but I don't any more.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c56bbgh","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1340812536","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqlo","link_id":"t3_vop4n","parent_id":"t3_vop4n","score":"474","retrieved_on":"1429242656","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c56bbgh","subreddit":"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","ups":"474","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"If you walk around greeting people by giving them friendly punches in the arm, then chances are you're going to end up hurting somebody. Maybe it wasn't your intent, but somebody got hurt and it's worth thinking about why.\n\nWhen we think about common insults being thrown around like faggot, retard, nigger, etc. We should think about what these words mean, what the history of the word is, and how this word is used. If we're using the word \"faggot\"  as an insult, we're saying that homosexuality is something that should be frowned upon. Of course, a lot of people might say these things with jest with no ill intent but plenty of people still use these words as hateful insults and plenty of people have been on the recieving end of these words when ill intent was used. It is also worth noting that there are still lots of genuine homophobes/racists/sexists/etc out there and they might find it more acceptable to spew their shit if other people are saying similar things. \n\nFinally, there is a psychological phenomenon called priming. For example, if you say racist stuff a lot even if you're joking, it ends up making you more racist whether you intended to or not. \n\nIt is preferable, in my eyes to use alternatives like \"asshole\" because they lack those historical and marginalizing connotations. \n\n","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cbwjgjo","author":"stevejavson","author_flair_text":"12\u2206","downs":"0","created_utc":"1377638396","subreddit_id":"t5_2w2s8","link_id":"t3_1l7npm","parent_id":"t1_cbwj4e1","score":"292","retrieved_on":"1429679262","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cbwjgjo","subreddit":"changemyview","ups":"292","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":"points ","removal_reason":null}

{"body":"**Circuit City**. It's less relevant since they are no longer in business, but perhaps this is due to concerns over a federal indictment.\n\nI am not convinced Circuit City was in business to make a profit. In fact, it seems likely that they were a front for a criminal organization to launder large sums of money. Most large box retailers follow the same strategies to maximize sales, all of which Circuit City seem to flaunt.\n\n1. Locate your building in prime real estate. Circuit City was always located in a second-tier location. It was never on a main boulevard by a large shopping center, but tucked around a corner a few miles from everything else.\n\n2. Keep aisle width to a minimum. Circuit City, on the other hand, thought it wise to have aisles wide enough for an 18 wheeler to go through. CC's strategy here seems to be to *minimize* the amount of product they can keep in the store, despite big box stores making money off of the number of sales rather than purely on margins on products.\n\n3. Place either popular or impulse buys at the front. Contrary to this, Circuit City seemed to regularly place large household appliances, antiquated TVs,  or vacuum cleaners at the front because it's obvious that Joe Schmoe who saunters into Circuit City may splurge and purchase a new washer.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cdu81j7","author":"kgbdrop","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1386259255","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_1s5sho","parent_id":"t3_1s5sho","score":"3278","retrieved_on":"1428384926","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cdu81j7","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"3278","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Oh god. I feel your pain. Here are my stories, both from PICKUP.\n\nA hot shot who supposedly used to play major junior in Europe slashed me in the hands behind the net, so I gave him some shit going up the ice. Play goes up and back down the ice, I am trying to get a pass out of my skates and BANG! I get put through the boards. I am told he skated 80 feet across the ice to lay me out. He is fucking big, too.\n\nI got up and was like \"you're fucking crazy, fuck you\" skating back to the bench away from him, and he pulls my helmet off and puts me in a headlock at center ice screaming not to fuck with him. I went home after that. He showed up at the next pickup and kept threatening me during our little warmup time. The other guys told him he had to stop coming and that this isn't the fucking elite series here. We were tired of him and his ECHL tryout failure buddy literally only playing with each other, anyway.\n\nThat was all child's play compared to the time I had my teeth knocked out, though! I'm in the corner leaning on this kid who is trying to freeze the puck like it's the NHL, and I eventually manage to snow-shovel the thing loose and move it up ice. I am skating very casually back to the bench, when all the sudden my lights go out and I am on the ice looking at blood.\n\nThe dude straight up slashed me in the teeth, hard. I felt for my mouth and allll my upper teeth were dangling. I got into the locker room bathroom and jammed them back in, and then stuffed my mouth with paper towels and bit down really hard. Nobody could find the kid. The zamboni driver told me how to get to the hospital. Had to have my teeth literally rearranged the next day, and I will have expensive dental problems in my later years because half my teeth are dead. Because I leaned on the wrong guy!\n\nA note: If you get slashed in the mouth, do yourself a favor and take off all your equipment before you go for treatment. I sat in the ER waiting room for 45 minutes with my lowers still on, like an asshole.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cej6nx5","author":"thiazzi","author_flair_text":"WSHAltNHL","downs":"0","created_utc":"1389059399","subreddit_id":"t5_2qiel","link_id":"t3_1uk8vx","parent_id":"t1_cej2ygs","score":"45","retrieved_on":"1431831147","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cej6nx5","subreddit":"hockey","ups":"45","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":"WSHAltNHL","removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Reddit is the Holden Caulfield of internet forums - they hate phonies above all else.\n\nFedoras have gotten a repuation as an item of clothing that people wear when trying to act/look like someone else.\n\nImagine a socially awkward young man who gets it into his head that he wants to change and be someone else. He could go for the pain and grind of sincerely trying to improve himself - socialize, gym, leaving his comfort zone etc - orrrr he could just buy whatever clothes he thinks make him look different.\n\nEnter the fedora (and trench coat, usually). Here we hit two mysterious trends:\n\n* Awkward young men seem to be drawn to the idea of 'having class', without fully understanding how complex the social etiquette surrounding this concept is (I know I can't define it easily). In reality, they only 'know' that it makes them better than other people and jump at it.\n\n* Young men seem to think that a fedora and trenchcoat will make them look classy in the eyes of other people\n\nAgain, this is a stereotype, but like many others, there's a grain of truth in it.\n\nSo, when someone is wearing a fedora, the prejudice is that they're not wearing it because they sincerely like the look, and want to express themselves genuinely; but rather that they're a phony who only wants to look like they're better than other people, and, presumably, have an attitude to match.\n\nAnd thus, many redditors hate fedoras, and the people who wear them.\n\nedit: splelleing\n","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cgt432v","author":"mynameipaul","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1397580382","subreddit_id":"t5_2sokd","link_id":"t3_233k7o","parent_id":"t3_233k7o","score":"1315","retrieved_on":"1433366768","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cgt432v","subreddit":"explainlikeimfive","ups":"1315","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"&gt;I don't suppose you did forgemaster when he was bugged for a whole week\n\nA bug is a bug, not difficulty or anything interesting. It's not part of the boss fight, therefore it's irrelevant to the design. Also, we downed him once and never cared to kill him again because his trash is annoying as fuck.\n\nIron council hard mode was fun, iron council boss models being trash mobs or quest mobs outside in the zone completely killed it for me. Nothing special just a stat change!!!! and a little bit bigger. XT hardmode is anti resto shaman and therefore I will hate it forever, They nerfed chain heal range to 5 yard bounces, you had to stand like 10 yards away from everyone. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCKKKKK that fight. Anyone that says Mimiron was fun is a masochist. I enjoyed Hodir hard mode too.\n\nI hate the unoriginality Blizzard went through, Onyxia again!!!!!! Ragnoros again!!!! Nefarian again! Nax AGAIN!!@$E!@RFW I hated Naxx, never saw it in vanilla everyone praised it as the best instance ever made! Saw it in TBC my words were \"The bosses are all 1-mechanic dps races against enrage timers with a few exceptions.\" And those few exceptions were bad, excluding the last two. The last two bosses were lovely! Involved, intuitive, knew it was your fault when you died, not DPS IT DOWN IN 5 MINUTES BEFORE ENRAGE AMGGGGGGGGGGGGG.\n\nThen naxx was the first instance in Wrath fffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu Instance was garbage. Also it was easy as hell, we got undying by accident on our first 10 man. Never got immortal because every 25 man guild was carrying a fire-stander.\n\nToC was literally Hitler, where the hell is my Azjol'Nerub!!!!! THOSE INSTANCES WEREN'T REAL. ANUB'ARAK, MY FAVORITE UNDEAD CHAMPION WAS NOT BASTARDIZED--TWICE! LALALALALALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!\n\nYeah fuck Sunwell, we only killed Felmyst(postnerf) on the day before Wrath hit. It was a terribly balanced instance that force precise compositions. I might have enjoyed it more if the 30% nerfed version was the legit one. Also Mu'ru was a terrible boss. It's a flat pile of energy, where you kill adds, then it becomes a voidwalker and you have to kill it before the voidwalker enrage kills you, then it has another enrage timer. What a shitty boss. I was pulled into heal it when our server's major progression guild needed to stack MOAR SHAMAN.\n\nSide note I will now list the top 3 raids I loved progressing through.  \n1) Hyjal-Karazahan (DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE!)  \n2) SSC  \n3) BT  \n\nTop 3 most well designed raids--imo of course.  \n1) **ULDUAR**  \n2) Hyjal  \n3) ICC\n\nAesthetically pleasing  \n1) ZA  \n2) Ulduar  \n3) Kara\n\nShit list progression  \nVANILLA + TK\n\nShit list Design  \n1) AQ40, 20 minute walk back to C'thun anybody?  \n2) **ToC**  \n3) SSC\n\nShit list in Asthetics  \n1) ICC -- It's a fucking tower with 3 levels, I expected more stairs not taking a flying boat to the damn top. Seriously this REALLY ruined my immersion in this instance, in the blizzard interview \"It was really interesting working with verticle design in mind usually our raids are flat, but I think we did a good job\" I could have taken my flying mount to the top, I don't need your damn boat. Now I list it as good design, because it used teleporters properly, trash was interesting and well placed, also it had well designed boss rooms and areas for combat, it just sucked at being a tower.  \n2) Gruul's Lair, it was a brown cave!  \n3) Naxx -- green ooze everywhere in these massive corridors, NOTHING BUT GREEN OOZE AND COBWEBS! That's so boring, holy tits.\n\n*note I did not play cata, I can't even name a raid instance.\n\nedited some grammar.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c8hd5ym","author":"geeca","author_flair_text":"","downs":"0","created_utc":"1361217798","subreddit_id":"t5_2qio8","link_id":"t3_18qbea","parent_id":"t1_c8h98yi","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1431331690","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c8hd5ym","subreddit":"wow","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":"alliance-monk","removal_reason":null}

He was also really well spoken, and I've always been too polite for my own good.\n\nNo lie, this raggedy dude with the plastic bags looks at me dead in the eye and says:\n\n\"Do you masturbate?\"\n\nFor no apparent reason whatsoever, I respond \"Yeah?\" \n\nAnd he goes: \"Are your orgasms long or short?\"\n\nAt this point we've reached the top of the escalator and I'm thoroughly freaked out so I tell this guy \"I have to meet my dad outside.  He's a cop.\" And the guy just nods and says OK and heads back down into the station.  It wasn't that big of a deal, but I still think about it every time I come.  \n\nEdit: Punctuation\nEdit 2: They are short. But powerful...\nEdit 3: On an even creepier note, I smoked a blunt with one of the Boston Bombers years ago.  I feel the need to say I'm horrified and disgusted by what they did.  They weren't friends of mine, but I had met the older one through a mutual acquaintance and I was just smoking a lot of pot with randos in those days.  I remember him being somewhat opinionated in the \"America is imperialist as fuck\" sense, but nothing out too out of the ordinary.

{"body":"Even this doesn't put his quote in the proper context.  In fact, he was expressing concerns about specific claims made in scientific papers.  The quote in its entirety gives a better idea of why he said what he said:\n\n&gt;Mr. {Barton.} Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I ask my\n&gt;questions, I am going to read a paragraph from Dr. Apt's\n&gt;statement or paper that he wrote because we are here debating\n&gt;a renewable energy standard because we think that there is a\n&gt;theory that manmade emissions, primarily from fossil fuels\n&gt;like coal, which reduce amounts of CO2, are causing climate\n&gt;change, i.e., the temperature to rise, and one of the\n&gt;solutions being proposed is an RES that is going to rely\n&gt;fairly heavily on wind power, which obviously doesn't create\n&gt;CO2. I am going to read a paragraph which is if true very\n&gt;ironic, and this is from Dr. Apt's paper and I quote: ``Wind\n&gt;energy is a finite resource. At large scale, slowing down\n&gt;the wind by using its energy to turn turbines has\n&gt;environmental consequences. A group of researchers at\n&gt;Princeton University,'' which is in New Jersey,\n&gt;parenthetically ``found that wind farms may change the mixing\n&gt;of air near the surface, drying the soil near the site. At\n&gt;planetary scales, David Keith, who was then at Carnegie\n&gt;Mellon, and coworkers found that if wind supplied 10 percent\n&gt;of expected global electricity demand in 2100, which is a number\n&gt;of years off, the resulting change in the earth's\n&gt;atmospheric energy might cause some regions of the world to\n&gt;experience temperature change of approximately 1 degree\n&gt;Centigrade,'' which I think is about 1-1/2 degrees or 1.6\n&gt;degrees Fahrenheit. Now, wind is God's way of balancing\n&gt;heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it is\n&gt;hotter to areas where it is cooler. That is what wind is.\n&gt;Wouldn't it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we\n&gt;mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite\n&gt;resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the\n&gt;temperature to go up? Now, I am not saying that is going to\n&gt;happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the\n&gt;massive scale--I mean, it does make some sense. You stop\n&gt;something. You can't transfer that heat and the heat goes\n&gt;up. It is just something to think about.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cli0uw3","author":"TennSeven","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1414107389","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh33","link_id":"t3_2k4mi1","parent_id":"t1_clhy50a","score":"595","retrieved_on":"1426380929","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cli0uw3","subreddit":"funny","ups":"595","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"I have this weird feeling like you didn't actually pay much attention to what you're reading.\n\n&gt;1: \n\nWhy is it irradiated? Fallout 1 takes place in 2161 and settlements already have farms, even in Los Angeles, where the destruction was so complete nothing was left but rubble. 200 years is a long time, the contamination should have long since dissipated. Besides, they've been scavenging food for ***200 years?*** WTF.\n\n&gt;2: \n\nAbsolutely no evidence of this.. besides, if it were true, see point one: why is everything so fucking irradiated and useless if the bombs were stopped? Again, the issue is that it is not explained. Just because you made something up on the spot doesn't excuse anything.\n\n&gt;3: \n\nGood lord, did you not read? The fact that the aliens were claimed to be canon is bad enough. The suggestion that they caused the Great War just makes it ***worse.*** Like a kick in the face once you're already down on the ground.\n\n&gt;4: \n\nIt was from the exact same batch as the FEV in Mariposa, which was capable of increasing the subject's mental ability along with its size (Batch 11-111, if I remember correctly, was the last batch produced) and it certainly was never concentrated.\n\nTerminal entries in V87 say that there were indeed modifications being made, however it also says that these modifications were failing and that the samples and subjects were being destroyed. Then again, the terminals also say some pretty lore breaking shit:\n\n&gt;**According to my autopsy, she died of a massive loss of brain function and was unable to sustain her basic bodily needs. This is the usual pattern we see in all the FEV Strains we test... the brains of the subjects becoming too damaged to support even the most basic human needs**\n\nYep, that's right. Every strain they test kills the subject. But they were given strains from Batch 11-111 which were *nothing* like this at all.\n\n&gt;5: \n\nBy the way things look in Fallout 3, the West Coast was hit ***way*** harder than the East Coast.\n\n&gt;1: \n\nWhat?\n\n&gt;2: \n\nThe only issue I was bringing up was that they were mislabeled. The \"Brotherhood Outcasts\" are outcasts of outcasts who are actually following the original mission, which means they're not actually outcasts. And on the flip side, Lyons' deserters are the ***actual outcasts.*** \n\n&gt;3, 4: \n\nNo, it's actually more like arguing whether or not its better to wear a suit or a clown costume to a funeral. Fallout 3's narrative style is \"fuck lore, fuck history, fuck sense, fuck writing, LET'S MAKE SHIT EPIC AS FUCK HOMIE\".. which is definitely a result of Todd Howard's influence.\n\nAlso, New Vegas' narrative style is also Fallout 1's and Fallout 2's. Fallout 3 is the only one that decided to go full retard (besides the spin-offs Tactics and FOBOS)\n\n&gt;5: \n\nSpringvale didn't have raiders when Megaton was settled :) The crater was allegedly caused by a plane crash... if you've ever seen crash footage, a Boeing 747 going straight into the ground barely puts a dent in the earth, let alone producing a crater a few dozen feet deep..\n\n[edit - meta] I said \"fuck\" 6 times in this comment, 5 of those times were in a single sentence in a mock quote.
