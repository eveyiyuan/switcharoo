I shared the initial research with the Academy of Harvested Discourse, which caused the first dedicated institute to investigate a problem in two decades. Once the Academy of Signal to Noise began broadcasting daily results, the world not only followed our progress, but also assisted in solving this unique problem. For the first time in a generation, people were excited and questioning the world around them. New questions and wonders were found, innovation reignited, a Golden Age of wonder and imagination sparked. Spirituality, a term that seemed archaic, reignited as the Church of the Switch-A-Roo (SAR) speculated the meaning for humanity.\n\nI, who represent a population excited, joyous, and filled with wonder, pay my respects to [jun2san](http://www.reddit.com/user/jun2san) for saving the future of humanity.\n\n{Signal to Noise Message END}","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c4hmj8v","author":"Ygaiee","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1335622348","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh0u","link_id":"t3_ia0ij","parent_id":"t1_c2xg05i","score":"16","retrieved_on":"1428814122","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c4hmj8v","subreddit":"pics","ups":"16","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"The best part of America, in my book, is that everything in this thread is potentially wrong. \n\nYes, a ton of food has HFCS and sugar and shit. But then every decent city has a fantastic farmer's market with certified organic food. Most of Europe can't even compete with the standards some of the organic restrictions.\n\nYes, there's a lot of chain stores. But there are also a TON of local restaurants in most big cities. And in the PNW, we have a huge focus on local food, and a big player in the slow food movement.\n\nYou can complain about the homegeny and chain stores. But then think of it. Within 5 miles of where I am, there is: american food(hamburgers, hot dogs, subway, etc), oysters harvested this morning, sushi from salmon caught just this morning, fresh crabs and clams, thai food, chinese food, japanese food, taiwanese food, indian food, pakistani food, ethiopian food, moroccan food, russian food, swedish food, texas barbeque, st louis barbeque, new york style deli, chicago style pizza, multiple salad bars, french bakeries and restaurants, etc. Any food you want is at your fingertips. \n\nComplain about our chocolate? Oh, you picked on Hershey's. How quaint. Try Theo's. Or Salazon. Or Ghiriadelli. Or Fran's. And much like your personal favorite chocolate, these aren't widely distributed. We have better chocolate than anybody else. And you know what? If that's not good enough for your precious little cacao receptors, you can just find a boutique chocolate shop that imports chocolates from all over the world!\n\nComplain about \"chain\" restaurants not cooking too much fresh food, or re-heating food? Well, this is fucking America. Go vote with your dollars. Stop eating there. Yes, you'll pay more for fresh food that's prepared to order, but it's worth it. A good chunk of the best restaurants in the world are in this country. If you can't find fresh/good-enough food, that's your problem, not America's. Trust me, I've found some real shit in France and Italy.\n\nThink we eat too much? I've seen England outside of London. I've seen France outside of Paris. I've seen Italy outside of Rome/Florence/Milan. I've seen Canada. Let's not pretend that other countries have no obesity problem.

{"body":"Okay. It's time for me to relive one of the darkest moments of my childhood. I really hope reddit appreciates this tale, because it's not a happy memory.\nI was in my mid-teens. I was at home, working on the computer and I heard a loud CRACK from the side door of the house. I turned around, wonder what the fuck? and saw a head through the kitchen window, rearing back to kick it again. I immediately knew someone was breaking in, so I grabbed the nearby wireless phone and started to run for cover.\nI wanted to go into my parents bedroom, because it had a lock on the door. Unfortunately, it was locked. So I ran into my own bedroom, dialing 9-1-1. By now, the two had broken in, and were walking down the hall toward the bedrooms. I slammed the door and knelt down by it to bar it closed, now talking with the dispatcher. I immediately gave them my address, and I remember the first thing I said to them: \"There's someone in my house. THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL ME!\"\nWhile hiding behind the door, I clearly heard them say \"Get the gun.\"\nSo naturally, I'm in complete defense mode. I severely doubted the wooden door could stop a bullet, so I did the only reasonable thing: tried to talk my way out of it. \"I never did anything to you! Just go away!\" keeping as low to the ground as possible, all the while expecting them to fire, wooden shrapnel exploding outward, likely killing me.\nBefore long, they had forced their way into my bedroom, but I still had my foot against it, as they demanded to know, \"Where's the fucking feta?\" Which I immediately figured to be slang for money. I had a small box of money under my bed, but it was only about $20, mostly in rolled quarters. I tried to hand this to them through the door, but they forced their way in.\nI could see they didn't actually have a gun, But they did however have knives, and I wasn't one to tempt the idea that their gun could still be concealed somewhere. They forced me into my parents bedroom, where they had already kicked in the door, again demanding \"Where's the fucking feta?\"\nI started looking through the places I knew they kept a hidden cache of emergency money, attempting to stall for time, but I wasn't able to find it. Soon the police had arrived, And everything until they forced me out of my room and took the phone was recorded by Dispatch.\nThey were two older boys my brother used to hang out with, but stopped when he refused to buy them beer. They were likely searching for drug money. They were both arrested and served time.\nAfter the attack, I slept in the bathroom for almost a week (The only other locking door in the house) until we got a security door for the side entrance. I still had night terrors for years, worrying that they would be back to kill us all in the middle of the night.\nLast I heard, the boy who organized the break-in is serving a life sentence for killing some elderly woman in town a few years ago. Good fucking riddance.\n(TL;DR- Go back and read the fucking story. I went to places I never want to return to for you people.)","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_clfeqmh","author":"TestZero","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1413880078","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_2jvagv","parent_id":"t3_2jvagv","score":"288","retrieved_on":"1426425751","controversiality":"0","gilded":"1","id":"clfeqmh","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"288","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"My dad used to do this to me, up to when I was like 13. I'm a girl, 24 now, only child. I wasn't allowed to close my room door all the way until I got to high school. And at night time when I went to bed, I could hear him standing by the door breathing for maybe 5 minutes but I kept my eyes closed. I thought he was making sure I wasn't pretending to be asleep so I wouldn't sneak off to the computer or something.\n\nOne night I opened my eyes and he was just standing there leaning against the doorway, with his arms crossed against his chest looking at me really sad. He said \"You're growing up. Go to sleep.\" and later when I became an adult he told me he missed watching me talk and sing to myself when I'd play alone as a kid.\n\nEnjoy it as much as you can while you can :)\n\n*EDIT:* Haha okay, there's a good handful of you still pretty creeped out, which is understandable since it's just words and the context/background isn't entirely there.

Crazy shit. When he got married to my mom and had me, he wanted to be the father he didn't have and was determined to raise me in a safe loving home. My pops is quite the sweet gentle soul and my little story is about him enjoying the self-satisfaction of achieving his dream for me and himself.

It's difficult to describe the depth and vehemence of my hatred for Bush. I'd like to see him get spit on wherever he goes. I'd like to see clerks and waiters refuse to acknowledge his presence. I'd be completely okay with him being abducted and tortured on live webcam for a few decades. In fact, I'd probably frame a feed of that and put it on my wall.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c4t6fx1","author":"Phallindrome","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1338185378","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","link_id":"t3_u82v7","parent_id":"t1_c4t5xf2","score":"-1","retrieved_on":"1429014554","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c4t6fx1","subreddit":"politics","ups":"-1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

I'd see someone doing something, sit beside them and join them, whether that was putting together a puzzle, jumping in place, or sitting in the dirt and tossing pebbles.

{"body":"TL;DR: I had a BB gun in my hand when the police showed up on a 911 call.  Act cool and don't get shot.\n\n1979: I had my father's [Crosman Marksman Repeater BB gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO1K_UHqIns). An innocent pistol BB gun that looks real enough. I was target practicing at the edge of the woods.  The next thing I hear is a police officer telling me to \"Put the weapon down.\"\n\nI moved SLOWLY with my arm extended and the gun in a non-threatening grip between my thumb and first finger while calling out \"It's just a BB gun!  It's just a BB gun!\" \n\nAs I placed the gun on the ground, I slowly turned and saw that he was on the opposite side of the car with his hand on his hip.\n\nAccording to the officer's conversation with my father, he had a report that someone was firing a rifle at houses.  I did no such thing with no such weapon.  However, that was his mental state when he showed up to confront me.  He was thinking \"I have to face down a maniac with a gun.  I WILL be going home to my wife and kids.\"\n\nLessons Learned that I teach my kids:  \n - Never assume that just because you ARE NOT a threat that the police will won't assume that you ARE a threat.  \n - The officer on the scene will not have the correct information and it will paint you MUCH WORSE in his/her eyes.  \n - Caller's to 911 will \"mistakenly\" relay \"facts\" to get the fastest response time.  \n - COMPLY! DO WHAT THE OFFICER TELLS YOU TO DO WHEN HE/SHE TELLS YOU TO DO IT.  \n - Police officers are trained to use a higher level of force on you than you will use on them.  I had a BB gun.  He had a real fucking gun.  \n\nNote on the tale of the gun:  It eventually broke.  I gave it to my cousin.  He traded it for a boa constrictor.

{"body":"Proper translation. Note that i've updated it about 2-3 hours after creation.\n_____\n\n**Mark Stroop [oo as in Roosevelt], who runs a car rental business in IJsselstein, isn't scared easily. When two of his cars were stolen and taken to Iraqi Kurdistan, he went to retrieve them himself. It turned into a bizarre journey that ended with a tough negotiation about the release of the thief of his cars.**\n\nThey're there in the hall behind his house: the black Opel Cascada and a silver-grey Volkswagen Golf. Both convertibles. Maybe not the most interesting cars in Stroops inventory, but certainly the best story.\n\n**\"I rented them to jihadis\"**\n\nBecause how bizarre was it late September, when Stroop saw the cars rented by a Sherzad and Mehmed, drive towards the Middle East through his built-in track &amp; trace system. \"Sometimes i watch where my cars are driving on my computer So i see those cars enter Turkey! While they had to be returned the next day. I immediately knew: here comes trouble. And they even headed towards Syria. I thought: My god, i rented them to jihadis.\"\n\nThere wasn't a lot Stroop could do. Formally the cars weren't stolen yet. At night Stroop saw the cars drive along the Syrian border towards Iraq. An attempt to stop them at the border through the Dutch embassy came to late. But: the track &amp; trace system still worked. In the cities of Duhok and Sersink Stroop saw the long journey of his cars end. In Iraq.\n\nBut Stroop had a problem: rental cars that aren't returned are not insured. This would set back Stroops -otherwise stable- business Silverline \u20ac75.000, which he couldn't afford. \"I had to get those cars back.\"\n\n**Kalashnikov**\n\nIn his search for a good companion Stroop happened upon a 'mister Saman', a Kurdish Dutchman who works for the local police and is helping establish a police union according to Western standards in Iraqi Kurdistan. \"He was willing to come along\", says Stroop, who arranged for a car through an acquaintance of Saman when they arrived in the city of Arbil. \"And that acquaintance casually threw a Kalashnikov on the back-seat\", says Stroop. \"He thought it was important, they *had* to bring it. That really made clear where we were.\"\n\nThrough Saman, Stroop quickly met one of the top police chiefs in northern Iraq. \"They had never seen that before, a Dutchman who came to look for his stolen cars. Perhaps that's why they were willing to help.\" In the meantime however, the thieves had removed the track &amp; trace system from the cars. They really needed the police to help them, but it took three whole days of Stroop collecting stamp after stamp: from the Iraqi minister of Internal Affairs to the court and from the local police to Interpol. All of Iraqi Kurdistan was looking for the convertibles from IJsselstein. On the way home Stroop received a telephone call: the cars and the thieves had been found.\n\nStroop was relieved, but the bureaucratic battle had yet to begin: a truckload of Iraqi authorities had to get translated and signed documents that proved Mark Stroop was the lawful owner of the convertibles they had tracked down. When Stroop, along with his friends Jos and Jolle, finally was allowed to retrieve his cars in Duhok in November, the scariest moment had yet to come.\n\n**Police**\n\nBecause suddenly a captain of the military police showed up: a full cousin of Sherzad, the 'brains' behind the operation. It quickly became clear what the captain wanted: he was free to take the cars, but would Stroop be willing to drop the charges against nephew Sherzad so he wouldn't have to spend years in jail?\n\n\"It turned out Sherzad would get a 15-year sentence. I explained to them i spent $10.000 to retrieve the cars. After a long negotiation they were willing to pay 7000. When i finally agreed to that, because i wanted to leave in one piece, the atmosphere changed completely and they even offered me lunch.\"\n\nThe journey home was 4500 km. Now they're back, in the hall in IJsselstein, between some much nicer cars. \"After this adventure these really are my babies\", Stroop jokes.\n_____\n\nDone. That takes surprisingly long.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold, stranger! In your honour i've actually gone over the translation a second time and made a bunch of corrections and improvements.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cel8er2","author":"anarchistica","author_flair_text":"The Netherlands","downs":"0","created_utc":"1389270355","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4j","link_id":"t3_1us79m","parent_id":"t3_1us79m","score":"57","retrieved_on":"1431866804","controversiality":"0","gilded":"1","id":"cel8er2","subreddit":"europe","ups":"57","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":"NETH","removal_reason":null}

{"body":"This is something that someone might know, but I sure as hell don't. So, I was on a bus to Georgia to visit my SO. I figured a bus wouldn't be terrible fare and wouldn't be a terrible night. Boy, was I wrong. At about one in the morning, everyone is trying to sleep. We transferred about 20 minutes ago, and everyone was just settling in and drifting. \n\nThen a scream pierces the bus. It can only be described as a mixture of a shriek and a pornstar orgasming. Everyone's scared awake. There's a girl, gripping and gnawing into her seat, still asleep, screaming, and nobody knows what to do. She does that for about 15 seconds and rolls back over. Someone wakes her and checks on her, and she doesn't remember it, she seems okay. Everyone starts drifting again.\n\nThe girl does this again, about 10 minutes later. The entire bus wakes up again, the assistant driver ends up sitting next to her to make sure she's okay. She's not. She does this again. And again. And again.\n\nMercifully, thankfully, after the next transfer, she's knocked out on sleeping pills. She's gone at the next stop, but for the life of me, I have no idea what happened. \n\nThe black dude next to me said \"Man, this is some possessed shit.

{"body":"&gt; Ol' reddit switcharoo\n\nThis is a really good ELI5 thread explaining it from about a year ago. \n\n&gt; In posts and comment threads on subreddits like /r/pics, there's an old joke where someone will post a picture of themselves with someone easily recognizable or famous. Then, invariably, someone will reply \"Wow, {famous person's name}, I didn't know you were {at location, redditor's username, etc}. But who's that person you met today?\"\n\n&gt; Basically, the setup assumes that the famous person is the redditor, instead of the redditor meeting someone famous.\n\n&gt; Eventually, a guy named jun2san started making fun of this joke in his own way. He started saying \"Ahhhh, the old reddit switch-a-roo\" as a reply to this tired joke and linking back to his own comments each time, thus creating an unbroken chain back to his very first comment.\n\n&gt; The chain caught on, as clever things on reddit do, and as more users started doing it themselves, the chain started branching. Some people started messing up the fun by intentionally editing their replies to break the chain, or started linking directly to the last post in the chain. Also, with so many branches, no one really knew which one to link to anymore.\n\n&gt; So PurpleSfinx created /r/switcharoo, to keep the chain organized. Each new link in the chain is posted to the subreddit, and then the next link can be linked to the previous piece of the chain. This helps keep the chain organized and it grows day by day, making the journey to the original post even more of a quest.\n\n/u/CedarWolf\n","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_cepc4ye","author":"catch22milo","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1389716049","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_1v701x","parent_id":"t1_cepc1ge","score":"1518","retrieved_on":"1431938373","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cepc4ye","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"1518","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"I wasn't a 911 operator, but a supervisor for AT&amp;T's '00 Info' directory information (think 411). While remotely listening in on some agents one evening one particular call was escalated to tier 2 for assistance. On the other end of the line was a woman who was hysterical saying her husband was trying to kill her. \n\nProtocol dictates that we trace the number to the local LEC (local exchange carrier) and notify law enforcement in the area. We do this but we had no way to connect the call to the local sheriff dispatch (silly I know, but we technically weren't true operators and our equipment didn't support that functionality). Basically we had to act as a relay between the LEO and the victim on the phone. \n\nBy this time I had moved from my office to seat myself next to the tier 2 agent to help her keep her cool while everything was going down. The agent, let's call her April (because that's her name) was handling the call very well at first but started to lose her shit as the call progressed. \n\nWhile listening in on the call next to April and trying to convey what is going on to the LEO on the other line, we hear the woman who initially called in say:\n\nHer: He went to get an axe! \n\nUs: Ma'am, where are you now?\n\nHer: I'm locked in the bathroom, please hurry!\n\nUs: The sheriff's office is on their way, they say they are five minutes out.\n\nThen we hear loud banging on the door. Her husband was trying to chop his way through the door with the axe. April lost it when she heard the woman start screaming knowing her husband was coming after her with an axe.  She threw her headset off and walked away saying something like 'I can't do it, LuckyInk! I can't!' April heads off to the ladies room to collect herself. \n\nSo I pick up the headset to reassure the lady on the phone. \n\nMe: Ma'am, the sheriff is at your house now. Where is your husband.\n\nHer: Back bathroom, he is at the door!\n\nMore loud banging from the axe. By this time the woman was overly hysterical and crying madly. \n\nThen: \n\n\"Sheriffs department, drop the axe!\"\n\n\"SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT, DROP THE DAMN AXE!\"\n\n**Pop pop, pop pop**\n\nThe local LEO dispatch directed me to ask the lady open the bathroom door and she does. The next voice I heard on her phone was a Sheriff Deputy. All he said was this:\n\n'The situation is under control, operator. Disengage the call.'\n\n\nI still get chills and all teary thinking about it.\n____________________________\n\n**EDIT:** OK, I get it. I said 'local LEC (Local Exchange Carrier)'. Akin to 'RIP in peace'. You're each so very clever for pointing that out...\n____________________________","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_chefmnx","author":"luckyink","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1399731472","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_257agn","parent_id":"t3_257agn","score":"3412","retrieved_on":"1433735271","controversiality":"0","gilded":"1","id":"chefmnx","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"3412","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

I wouldn't even go near them because they didn't like me.  One actually kicked me, and the trauma of being kicked by the Llama caused me to get a huge bruise on my leg.  The farmer was worried that my leg might be broken, so he suggested I go to the hospital and have it checked out.

So far so good.\n\nThen he wrote an article basically bashing Zynga going on about how they were an evil company that he would never want to work for. This article pissed off the CEO of Omgpop so he publicly dissed the developer back with unsubstantiated claims about how he was the worst developer and were about to be fired etc.\n\nSo basically, two immature people who would be better off not venting their feelings in public forums.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c477dz8","author":"rabbitlion","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1333258674","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh03","link_id":"t3_rnaar","parent_id":"t1_c476fns","score":"111","retrieved_on":"1428633448","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c477dz8","subreddit":"gaming","ups":"111","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

This video was made by her father. If you know where she is and that she is safe, please let me or the Amarillo, TX police department or her father know. I don't have any contact information for him except for Youtube. Maybe you can find his Twitter, and I will work on contact info. We are all worried about her. I'm not saying you have to reveal where she is, but let us know she is safe. Please spread this video. With any luck, she will see it and at least send some kind of message. Thank you, Reddit. For anything you can do.\n\nEdit: Her father's name is Ray Wilson. You can find him on Facebook. For now, I don't know what I would have permission to post for him.

{"body":"This happened to me when I was 16. \n\nI worked at a grocery store and my first day on the job this girl, who I only said like three sentences to handed me a note before she left for the day and told me not to read it until she was gone. \n\nWell, I thought a note was a bit weird since that was grade school stuff but whatever. I open the note and it says things like: \n\n\"I love you, I want to be with you, we need to have children together even though we're both only teenagers\" and it just prattled on and on. Overly attached girlfriend has nothing on this chick. \n\nSo the next day at work she asks sheepishly if I've read her note and I said yes but I wasn't really looking for a relationship at the time. Her face lost all expression for a second and then she smiled and said something to the effect of \"No worries, I thought I'd try\" and we continued on working. \n\nThat night, when I left work there were about 50 notes taped to my Jeep. LONG notes too! I have no clue how she wrote this much in a day. The notes said things like \"I hate you  you're a fucking asshole I hope you die \" and other notes said things like \"I'm sorry for writing that note that called you an asshole. I really like you and want to be with you &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3\"\n\nShe would then try luring me with innuendos. When she was on her lunch break she would do things like buy these huge dill pickles that we sold (making sure to come through my line) and say things like \"Do you think this pickle is for lunch or personal pleasure?\" *gag* \n\nShe would also still put notes all over my Jeep.

{"body":"The cataclysm raids were awful, bar none. I have no issue saying that and I played through all of them. (Also a vanilla to now vet, btw. Did all the raids you've mentioned wooo!)\n\nThrone of the 4 winds was pleasing aesthetically and also had some really fun mechanics, but nobody liked doing it because of the randomized loot and fact that it required so much coordination. (I loved it, though. Thought the fights were fun!)\n\nSeriously, after I saw your post I sat here thinking, \"Well which was the best raid in Cataclysm? UMmm. Hmm. hmmm...uuuh...well...no no that one was bad...hmm.\"\n\nBlackwing Descent was basically BWL version 2, except with jumbled boss mechanics. (Haha Omnitron and Nef + Ony.) Twilight whatever was bland. The only good part about it was Sinestra.\n\nFirelands was abysmal. Just an open air, ugly area with trash, trash, trash. And then boss fights. And then Rag again! Rhyolith lol. Rhyolith.\n\nAnd dragonsoul? Head to wyrmrest temple, port to different bosses, then fight deathwing for a half an hour at a time.\n\nAnd I realize I may get downvoted for saying this but to me, Cataclysm's raids had very little redeeming qualities. WOTLK had its bad raids (like TOC) but Ulduar was just...amazing. It made the expansion. (Which is funny because you'd think that would have been ICC.)\n\nCata was just...all bad raids. With no Ulduar-like raid to make up for it.\n\nI'll defend cataclysm for what it was, but looking back on it like this really makes me realize what an awful expansion it really was for max level toons.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c8hdsqo","author":"beepborpimajorp","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1361219669","subreddit_id":"t5_2qio8","link_id":"t3_18qbea","parent_id":"t1_c8hd5ym","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1431331985","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c8hdsqo","subreddit":"wow","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Let me put an end to a lot of the speculation going on in this thread. I feel I'm one of the few people who can answer this in certainty as I'm a neuroscientist who performs live decapitations on a weekly basis.\n\nThere are many methods to harvest a brain from a rat but my research calls for live decapitations as I work on very sensitive systems in the brain that are affected by any other sort of perfusion. When I watched my first live decap, I was worried that the rat felt pain. Even though I've never heard of an incomplete live decap (imagine a rat guillotine; it's very efficient), I wondered if the nerves still projected pain.\n\nYou can use a series of analytical techniques (qRT-PCR for the interested) to detect pain response in the brain on *any* level. I performed this on many pain receptors in the brain using fresh tissue and I found nothing.\n\n**Tl;dr: there is NO pain in a COMPLETE live decapitation**\n\nSource: Current neuroscientist studying stress on memory in rats\n\nFirst edit: grammar\n\nSecond edit: grammar \n\nThird edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!\n","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_civcjj0","author":"seanthesavage","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1405164530","subreddit_id":"t5_2sokd","link_id":"t3_2ahzqo","parent_id":"t3_2ahzqo","score":"3426","retrieved_on":"1435473308","controversiality":"0","gilded":"1","id":"civcjj0","subreddit":"explainlikeimfive","ups":"3426","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"Let me tell you a story.\n\nWhen I was eight years old, my mom and I went to K-Mart. On our way in, I saw a poster on the wall for quite possibly the coolest thing ever for an eight year old: a Lego building contest, with judges and Lego sets for prizes. Holy. Fuck. My parents let me stay up late for two weeks building this huge two or three foot long spaceship with a million compartments and smaller ships that came out of the big ship and basically everything else that I had.\n\nThe day of the contest arrives. We're led down a hallway in the back and into a small, blank room with a few chairs and a table. \"That's the other entry\" they said, pointing towards the table. As they walked away, I couldn't believe it. Someone had just bought a firetruck model, put it together, and entered it. In my excitement I had assumed the contest was one of creativity, not pure technical skill (which, I figured, could only be measured by the time it took to assemble, not the finished product). Not to mention that, we were the only two entries there.\n\nMy mom and I sat down and waited for the judges to arrive. And waited. And waited. After almost an hour and a half, I had to accept the sad truth that my dreams had been broken. I shivered for the first time at how cold the world could be. Dejected, I hung my head on the way to the parking lot as I clutched my spaceship, star-bound no longer.\n\nFuck you, K-Mart.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c4old1s","author":"electricgeoffrey","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1337142179","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_tpct0","parent_id":"t3_tpct0","score":"2610","retrieved_on":"1428934545","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c4old1s","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"2610","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"For about 3 years my dad wouldn't let me listen to music when I was with him. My mom and him were never married, but I visited him a couple times a month. Whenever I visited him he wouldn't let me listen to music, AT ALL. Not on my headphones, not on the stereo, not in the car, nowhere. I fucking LOVE music. I listen to music all day every day.\n\nAnd what was so weird about it was HE loved music. He owned 2 guitars, which he played often. He had recorded an album professionally at one point. It wasn't successful or anything (punk rock stuff in the 80s) and he had a HUGE vinyl collection. \n\nBut when I came to visit he would be like \"you listen to enough music when you're at your mom's.

{"body":"Future redditors, please listen to my tale of woe.\n\nAt first, I clicked on a few Switch-a-roo links, it was all in good fun. I clicked faster and faster, enjoying the interesting messages that others had left on their various journeys to the epicentre of the old Reddit Switch-a-roo. There were lots of interesting comments and stories, all quite entertaining. But after hitting about three weeks back, there was always a strange comment at the bottom - never upvoted or replied to - it just said \"nevermore\".\n\nCool, I thought. That's a great reference to the eternal Poe. But moving on further down the spiral, I came across this comment again and again. From different commenters each time, some new redditors, some old, respected redditors. It began to play with my mind. I searched through all the comments everywhere to find the inevitable \"nevermore\", always at the bottom, unreplied. At first it was interesting, then it started to seem quite important. Eventually I felt scared and compelled to keep searching down the chain to find what this \"nevermore\" means.\n\nI haven't moved from my chair in the last 14 hours. My fingernails are chewed down to where I can taste blood. Yesterday, I called work and resigned. Then I locked all the doors and put a supply of cup noodles where I can reach them. I've decided that there's nothing more important in life than finding out what that \"nevermore\" comment means. Nothing. Here I will remain, clicking, searching trying to find out what the answer actually is. Spare a thought for me while you go around your normal life and hope that dire compulsion never finds you.\n","score_hidden":"false","archived":"true","name":"t1_c3c8ic1","author":"SilverXGames","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1325198825","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_nv3p7","parent_id":"t1_c3c81sl","score":"-17","retrieved_on":"1428094226","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"c3c8ic1","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"-17","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}

{"body":"I baby sat my neighbors children when I was a junior  in high school. They were 13 , 10 and 9 or somewhere around there anyways. One day while I was dealing with the middle child trying to get into his fathers shotguns the other two snagged the keys to the extra car and locked  themselves in it. Having finished with the middle child I went outside to deal with the others. I tried telling them to get out of the car which worked about as well as you might expect... They turned the car on.\n\nAt this point I'm at a bit of a loss since I'm not really interested in breaking the window of the car to force them out. While I'm considering what I can do the oldest one manages to put the vehicle into drive. Wanting to prevent anything more serious I move from the driver side of the car to the front thinking that they wouldn't try move forward if  I was standing there. \n\nUnfortunately for me they didn't actually have any compunctions with hitting the gas. As I'm standing there hands on the hood of the car telling them to get out of the car, I hear the engine rev and feel the car jolt forward. Luckily because  of my position it wasn't hard to just kind of fall forward and roll off to the side of the car. \n\nThe car rolled to a halt after just a few seconds. The  sudden movement of the car and me rolling off the hood of the car was enough of a shock for a first time 'driver' that the oldest got out of the car to check on how  I was doing. The car  hadn't had any momentum behind and I wasn't injured in any way but it did give me the chance to get in the car and shut it off.\n\nWhile I was doing this, and having a chat with the oldest  about why what they had done was not a very smart move, the youngest ran into the house presumably to hide. When I walked in a few minutes later I found the youngest still in the kitchen, the first  room of  the house, brandishing a steak knife in the corner. Nothing came of it because  he was 9 and didn't really have any intention of doing anything.\n\nTheir parents came home not too long after all this happened and after getting paid I went home and left  the adults to deal with their children. I  can't really complain too much about any of this that babysitting job paid better than any job I've had since then somewhere in the range of  $50 an hour.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_crbl6mi","author":"Duae_Turres","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1431829866","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_367r8m","parent_id":"t3_367r8m","score":"218","retrieved_on":"1433106042","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"crbl6mi","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"218","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"removal_reason":null}
